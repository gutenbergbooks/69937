<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare’s Roman plays may be regarded as forming a group by
themselves, less because they make use of practically the same
authority and deal with similar subjects, than because they follow the
same method of treatment, and that method is to a great extent peculiar
to themselves. They have points of contact with the English histories,
they have points of contact with the free tragedies, but they are not
quite on a line with either class. It seems, therefore, possible and
desirable to discuss them separately.</p>

<p>In doing so I have tried to keep myself abreast of the literature
on the subject; which is no easy task when one lives at so great a
distance from European libraries, and can go home only on hurried and
infrequent visits. I hope, however, that there is no serious gap in the
list of authorities I have consulted.</p>

<p>The particular obligations of which I am conscious I have indicated
in detail. I should like, however, to acknowledge how much I owe
throughout to the late F. A. T. Kreyssig, to my mind one of the sanest
and most suggestive expositors that Shakespeare has ever had. I am
the more pleased to avow my indebtedness, that at present in Germany
Kreyssig is hardly receiving the learned, and in England has never
received the popular, recognition that is his due. It is strange that
while Ulrici’s metaphysical lucubrations and Gervinus’s somewhat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
ponderous commentaries found their translators and their public,
Kreyssig’s purely humane and literary appreciations were passed over.
I once began to translate them myself, but “habent sua fata libelli,”
the time had gone by. It is almost exactly half a century ago since his
lectures were first published; and now there is so much that he would
wish to omit, alter, or amplify, that it would be unfair to present
them after this lapse of years for the first time to the English
public. All the same he has not lost his value, and precisely in
dealing with the English and the Roman histories he seems to me to be
at his best.</p>

<p>One is naturally led from a consideration of the plays to a
consideration of their background; their antecedents in the drama, and
their sources, direct and indirect.</p>

<p>The previous treatment of Roman subjects in Latin, French, and English,
is of some interest, apart from the possible connection of this or
that tragedy with Shakespeare’s masterpieces, as showing by contrast
the originality as well as the splendour of his achievement. For this
chapter of my Introduction I therefore offer no apology.</p>

<p>On the other hand the sketches of the three “ancestors” of
Shakespeare’s Roman histories, and especially of Plutarch, need perhaps
to be defended against the charge of irrelevancy.</p>

<p>In examining the plays, one must examine their relations with their
sources, and in examining their relations with their sources, one
cannot stop short at North, who in the main contributes merely the
final form, but must go back to the author who furnished the subject
matter. Perhaps, too, some of the younger students of Shakespeare may
be glad to have a succinct account of the man but for whom the Roman
plays would never have been written. Besides, Plutarch, so far as I
know, has not before been treated exactly from the point of view that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
is here adopted. My aim has been to portray him mainly in those aspects
that made him such a power in the period of the Renaissance, and gave
him so great a fascination for men like Henry IV., Montaigne, and,
of course, above all, Shakespeare. For the same reason I have made
my quotations exclusively from Philemon Holland’s translation of the
<i>Morals</i> (1st edition, 1603) and North’s translation of the
<i>Lives</i> (Mr. Wyndham’s reprint), as the Elizabethan versions show
how he was taken by that generation.</p>

<p>The essay on Amyot needs less apology. In view of the fact that he was
the immediate original of North, he has received in England far less
recognition than he deserves. Indeed he has met with injustice. English
writers have sometimes challenged his claim to have translated from the
Greek. To me it has had the zest of a pious duty to repeat and enforce
the arguments of French scholars which show the extreme improbability
of this theory. Unfortunately I have been unable to consult the Latin
version of 1470, except in a few transcripts from the copy in the
British Museum: but while admitting that a detailed comparison of
that with the Greek and the French would be necessary for the formal
completion of the proof, I think it has been made practically certain
that Amyot dealt with all his authors at first hand. At any rate he
is a man, who, by rendering Plutarch into the vernacular and in many
instances furnishing the first draught of Shakespeare’s phrases, merits
attention from the countrymen of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Of North, even after Mr. Wyndham’s delightful and admirable study,
something remains to be said in supplement. And he too has hardly had
his rights. The <i>Morall Philosophie</i> and the <i>Lives</i> have
been reprinted, but the <i>Diall of Princes</i> is still to be seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
only in the great libraries of Europe. A hurried perusal of it two
years ago convinced me that, apart from its historical significance,
it was worthy of a place among the <i>Tudor Translations</i> and would
help to clear up many obscurities in Elizabethan literature.</p>

<p>I at first hoped to discuss in a supplementary section the treatment
of the Roman Play in England by Shakespeare’s younger contemporaries
and Caroline successors, and show that while in some specimens
Shakespeare’s reconciling method is still followed though less
successfully, while in some antiquarian accuracy is the chief aim, and
some are only to be regarded as historical romances, it ultimately
tended towards the phase which it assumed in France under the influence
of the next great practitioner, Corneille, who assimilated the
ancient to the modern ideal of Roman life as Shakespeare never did
and, perhaps fortunately, never tried to do. But certain questions,
especially in regard to the sources, are complicated, and, when
contemporary translations, not as yet reprinted, may have been used,
are particularly troublesome to one living so far from Europe. This
part of my project, therefore, if not abandoned, has to be deferred;
for it would mean a long delay, and I am admonished that what there is
to do must be done quickly.</p>

<p>I have complained of the lack of books in Australia, but before
concluding I should like to acknowledge my obligations to the
book-loving colonists of an earlier generation, to whose irrepressible
zeal for learning their successors owe access to many volumes that
one would hardly expect to see under the Southern Cross. Thus a 1599
edition of Plutarch in the University Library, embodying the apparatus
of Xylander and Cruserius, has helped me much in the question of
Amyot’s relations to the Greek. Thus, too, I was able to utilise, among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
other works not easily met with, the first complete translation of
Seneca’s Tragedies (1581), in the collection of the late Mr. David
Scott Mitchell, a “clarum et venerabile nomen” in New South Wales.
May I, as a tribute of gratitude, inform my English readers that this
gentleman, after spending his life in collecting books and manuscripts
of literary and historical interest, which he was ever ready to place
at the disposal of those competent to use them, bequeathed at his death
his splendid library to the State, together with an ample endowment for
its maintenance and extension?</p>

<p>For much valuable help in the way of information and advice, my thanks
are due to my sometime students and present colleagues, first and
chiefly, Professor E. R. Holme, then Mr. C. J. Brennan, Mr. J. Le
Gay Brereton, Mr. G. G. Nicholson, Dr. F. A. Todd; also to Messrs.
Bladen and Wright of the Sydney Public Library for looking out books
and references that I required; to Mr. M. L. MacCallum for making
transcripts for me from books in the Bodleian Library; to Professor
Jones of Glasgow University for various critical suggestions; above
all to Professor Butler of Sydney University, who has pointed out to
me many facts which I might have overlooked and protected me from
many errors into which I should have fallen, and to Professor Ker of
University College, London, who has most kindly undertaken the irksome
task of reading through my proofs.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">ROMAN PLAYS IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Plays that dealt with the History of Rome were frequent on the
Elizabethan stage, and all portions of it were laid under contribution.
Subjects were taken from legends of the dawn like the story of
Lucretia, and from rumours of the dusk like the story of Lucina; from
Roman pictures of barbarian allies like Massinissa in the South, or
barbarian antagonists like Caractacus in the North; as well as from the
intimate records of home affairs and the careers of the great magnates
of the Republic or Empire. But these plays belong more distinctively
to the Stuart than to the Tudor section of the period loosely named
after Elizabeth, and few have survived that were composed before the
beginning of the seventeenth century. For long the Historical Drama
treated by preference the traditions and annals of the island realm,
and only by degrees did “the matter of Britain” yield its pride of
place to “the matter of Rome the Grand.” Moreover, the earlier Roman
Histories are of very inferior importance, and none of them reaches
even a moderate standard of merit till the production of Shakespeare’s
<i>Julius Caesar</i> in 1600 or 1601. In this department Shakespeare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
had not the light to guide him that he found for his English Histories
in Marlowe’s <i>Edward II.</i>, or even in such plays as <i>The Famous
Victories of Henry V.</i> The extant pieces that precede his first
experiment, seem only to be groping their way, and it is fair to
suppose that the others which have been lost did no better. Their
interest, in so far as they have any interest at all, lies in the light
they throw on the gradual progress of dramatic art in this domain.
And they illustrate it pretty fully, and show it passing through some
of the main general phases that may be traced in the evolution of the
Elizabethan Tragedy as a whole. At the outset we have one specimen
of the Roman play in which the legitimate drama is just beginning to
disengage itself from the old Morality, and another in which the unique
Senecan exemplar is transformed rather than translated to suit the
primitive art of the time. Then we have several more artistic specimens
deriving directly or indirectly from the French imitators of Seneca,
which were the most dignified and intelligent the sixteenth century had
to show. And lastly we have a specimen of what the Roman play became
when elaborated by the scholar-playwrights for the requirements of the
popular London stage.</p>

<p>A survey of these will show how far the ground was prepared for
Shakespeare by the traditions of this branch of the drama when he
turned to cultivate it himself.</p>

<h4 id="APPIUS">1. APPIUS AND VIRGINIA.<br /> THE TRANSLATION OF OCTAVIA</h4>

<p>The crudest if not the earliest of the series is entitled <i>A new
Tragicall Comedie of Apius and Virginia</i>, by R. B., initials which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
have been supposed with some probability to stand for Richard Bower,
who was master of the Chapel Royal at Windsor in 1559. It was first
printed in 1575, but must have been written some years before. A
phrase it contains, “perhaps a number will die of the sweat,” has been
thought to refer to the prevalence of the plague in 1563, and it may
be identified with a play on the same subject that was acted at that
time by the boys of Westminster. At any rate several expressions show
beyond doubt that it was meant for representation, but only on the
old-fashioned scaffold which was soon to be out-of-date. Its character
and scope belong too, in part, to a bygone age. The prologue proclaims
its ethical intention with the utmost emphasis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You lordings all that present be, this Tragidie to heare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Note well what zeale and loue heerein doth well appeare,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Doo lead the life apparent heere to win immortall fame.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is written in commendation of chastity and rebuke of vice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let not the blinded God of Loue, as poets tearm him so,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Our Authour would rejoyce in hart, and we would leap for joy.</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">No Moral Play could be more explicit in its lesson, and
the Moral Play has also suggested a large number of the personages. Conscience,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
Justice, Rumour, Comfort, Reward, Doctrine, Memory, are introduced,
and some of them not only in scenes by themselves, but in association
with the concrete characters. Occasionally their functions are merely
figurative, and can be separated from the action that is supposed to
be proceeding: and then of course they hardly count for more than the
attributes that help to explain a statue. Thus, when Appius resolves to
pursue his ruthless purpose, he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But out, I am wounded: how am I deuided!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Two states of my life from me are now glided:</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and the quaint stage direction in the margin gives
the comment: “Here let him make as thogh he went out, and let Consience
and Justice come out of<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
him, and let Consience hold in his hande a Lamp burning, and let
Justice haue a sworde and hold it before Apius brest.” Thus, too,
another stage direction runs: “Here let Consience speake within:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Judge Apius, prince, oh stay, refuse: be ruled by thy friende:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What bloudy death with open shame did Torquin gaine in ende?’”</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p>And he answers: “Whence doth this pinching sounde desende?” Here
clearly it is merely the voice of his own feelings objectified: and in
both instances the interference of the Abstractions is almost wholly
decorative; they add nothing to the reflections of Appius, but only
serve to emphasise them. This however is not always the case. They
often comport themselves in every respect like the real men and women.
Comfort stays Virginius from suicide till he shall see the punishment
of the wicked. Justice and Reward (that is, Requital) summoned by the
unjust judge to doom the father, pronounce sentence on himself. In the
end Virginius enters in company with Fame, Doctrina, and Memory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>Other of the characters, again, if more than general ideas, are less
than definite individuals. There is a sub-plot not at all interwoven
with the main plot, in which the class types, Mansipulus, Mansipula,
and their crony, Subservus, play their parts. With their help some
attempt is made at presenting the humours of vulgar life. They quarrel
with each other, but are presently reconciled in order to divert
themselves together, and put off the business of their master and
mistress, hoping to escape the punishment for their negligence by
trickery and good luck. But we do not even know who their master and
mistress are, and they come into no contact with either the historical
or the allegorical figures.</p>

<p>The only personage who finds his way into both compartments of the
“Tragicall Comedie” is Haphazard the Vice, who gives the story such
unity as it possesses. His name happily describes the double aspect of
his nature. On the one hand he stands for chance itself; on the other
for dependence on chance, the recklessness that relies on accident,
and trusts that all will end well though guilt has been incurred. In
this way he is both the chief seducer and the chief agent, alike of the
petty rogues and of the grand criminal. To the former he sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then wend ye on and folow me, Mansipulus,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mansipula,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let croping cares be cast away; come folow me, come folow me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Subseruus is a joly loute</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Brace<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Haphazard, bould blinde bayarde!<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A figge for his uncourtesie that seekes to shun good company!</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">To Appius’ request for advice he replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Well, then, this is my counsell, thus standeth the case,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps such a fetche as may please your grace:</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no more wayes but <i>hap</i> or <i>hap not</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Either hap or els hapless, to knit up the knot:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And if you will hazard to venter what falles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps that Haphazard will end all your thralles.</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">His distinctive note is this, that he tempts
men by suggesting that they may offend and escape the consequences.
In the end he falls into the pit that he has digged for others,
and when his hap is to be hanged, like a true Vice he accepts the
<i>contretemps</i> with jest and jape.</p>

<p>Yet despite the stock-in-trade that it takes over from Morality or
Interlude, <i>Appius and Virginia</i> has specialties of its own
that were better calculated to secure it custom in the period of the
Renaissance. The author bestows most care on the main story, and makes
a genuine attempt to bring out the human interest of the subject and
the persons. In the opening scene he tries, in his well-meaning way,
to give the impression of a home in which affection is the pervading
principle, but in which affection itself is not allowed to run riot,
but is restrained by prudence and obligation. Father, mother, and
daughter sing a ditty in illustration of this sober love or its
reverse, and always return to the refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The trustiest treasure in earth, as we see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is man, wife, and children in one to agree;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then friendly, and kindly, let measure be mixed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With reason in season, where friendship is fixed.</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There is some inarticulate feeling for effect in
the contrast between the wholesomeness of this orderly family life and
the incontinence of the tyrant who presently seeks to violate it. And
the dramatic bent of the author—for it is no more than a bent—appears
too in the portraiture of the parties concerned. The mingled perplexity
and dread of Virginius, when in his consciousness of right he is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
summoned to the court, are justly conceived; and there is magnanimity
in his answer to Appius’ announcement that he must give judgment “as
justice doth require”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My lord, and reason good it is: your seruaunt doth request</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No parciall hand to aide his cause, no parciall minde or brest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If ought I haue offended you, your Courte or eke your Crowne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From lofty top of Turret hie persupetat me downe:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If treason none by me be done, or any fault committed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let my accusers beare the blame, and let me be remitted.</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Similarly, the subsequent conflict in his heart
between fondness for his daughter and respect for her and himself is
clearly expressed. And her high-spirited demand for death is tempered
and humanised by her instinctive recoil when he “proffers a blow”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The gods forgeue thee, father deare! farewell: thy blow do bend—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet stay a whyle, O father deare, for fleash to death is fraile.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let first my wimple bind my eyes, and then thy blow assaile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nowe, father, worke thy will on me, that life I may injoy.</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the most ambitious and perhaps the most
successful delineation is that of Appius. At the outset he is
represented as overwhelmed by his sudden yearning. Apelles, he thinks,
was a “prattling fool” to boast of his statue; Pygmalion was fond
“with raving fits” to run mad for the beauty of his work, for he could
make none like Virginia. Will not the Gods treat him as they treated
Salmacis, when Hermophroditus, bathing in the Carian fountain near the
Lycian Marches, denied her suit?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Oh Gods aboue, bend downe to heare my crie</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As once ye<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> did to Salmasis, in Pond hard Lyzia by:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh that Virginia were in case as somtime Salmasis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in Hermofroditus stede my selfe might seeke my blisse!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah Gods! would I unfold her armes complecting of my necke?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or would I hurt her nimble hand, or yeelde her such a checke?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would I gainsay hir tender skinne to baath where I do washe?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or els refuse her soft sweete lippes to touch my naked fleshe?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay! Oh the Gods do know my minde, I rather would requier</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To sue, to serue, to crouch, to kneele, to craue for my desier.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But out, ye Gods, ye bend your browes, and frowne to see me fare;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye do not force<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> my fickle fate, ye do not way my care.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unrighteous and unequall Gods, unjust and eke unsure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Woe worth the time ye made me liue, to see this haplesse houre.</div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This, we may suppose, is intended for a mad
outbreak of voluptuous passion, “the nympholepsy of some fond despair”;
and, as such, it is not very much worse than some that have won the
applause of more critical ages. It may suggest the style of the
Interlude in the <i>Midsummer-Night’s Dream</i>, or more forcibly, the
“<i>King Cambyses’</i> vein” that was then in vogue (for Preston’s play
of that name, published about a couple of years later than the probable
date when this was performed, is in every way the nearest analogue
to <i>Appius and Virginia</i> that the history of our stage has to
offer). But in comparison with the normal flow of the Moralities, the
lines have undoubtedly a certain urgency and glow. And there are other
touches that betray the incipient playwright. Appius is not exhibited
as a mere monster; through all his life his walk has been blameless,
and he is well aware of his “grounded years,” his reputation as judge,
and the value of good report. He is not at ease in the course he now
adopts; there is a division in his nature, and he does not yield to his
temptation without forebodings and remorse.</p>

<p>Nor was R. B., whether or not he was Richard Bower, Master of the
Chapel children, quite without equipment for the treatment of a
classical theme, though in this respect as in others his procedure is
uncertain and fumbling in the highest degree. The typical personages of
the under-plot have no relish of Latinity save in the termination of
the labels that serve them as names, and they swear by God’s Mother,
and talk glibly of church and pews and prayer books, and a “pair of
new cards.” Even in the better accredited Romans of Livy’s story there
are anachronisms and incongruities. Appius, though ordinarily a judge,
speaks of himself as prince, king or kaiser; and references are made
to his crown and realm. Nevertheless the author is not without the
velleities of Humanism. He ushers in his prologue with some atrocious
Latin Elegiacs, which the opening lines of the English are obliging
enough to paraphrase:</p>

<p>We are here indeed on the threshold of a very different kind of art, of
which, in its application to Roman history, a sample had been submitted
to the English public two years previously in the <i>Octavia</i>
ascribed to Seneca.</p>

<p>The Latin Tragedy, merely because it was Latin, and for that reason
within the reach of a far greater number of readers, was much better
known than the Greek at the period of the Renaissance. But apart from
its advantage in accessibility, it attracted men of that age not
only by its many brilliant qualities but by its very defects, its
tendency to heightened yet abstract portraiture, its declamation, its
sententiousness, its violence, its unrestfulness. It had both for good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and bad a more modern bearing than the masterpieces of Hellenic
antiquity, and in some ways it corresponded more closely with the
culture of the sixteenth century than with our own. It was therefore
bound to have a very decisive influence in shaping the traditions of
the later stage; and the collection of ten plays ascribed to Seneca,
the poor remainder of a numerous tribe that may be traced back to
the third century before Christ, furnished the pattern which critics
prescribed for imitation to all who would achieve the tragic crown.
And if this was true of the series as a whole, it was also true of
the play, which, whatever may be said of the other nine, is certainly
not by Seneca himself, the poorest of them all, with most of the
faults and few of the virtues of the rest, <i>Octavia</i>, the sole
surviving example of the <i>Fabula Praetexta</i>, or the Tragedy that
dealt with native Roman themes. The <i>Octavia</i>, however, was not
less popular and influential than its companions, and has even a claim
to especial attention inasmuch as it may be considered the remote
ancestress of the Modern Historic Play in general and of the Modern
Roman Play in particular. It inspired Mussato about 1300 to write in
Latin his <i>Eccerinis</i>, which deals with an almost contemporary
national subject, the fate of Ezzelino: it inspired the young Muretus
about 1544 to write his <i>Julius Caesar</i>, which in turn showed
his countrymen the way to treat such themes in French. Before eight
years were over they had begun to do so, and many were the Roman plays
composed by the School of Ronsard. Certainly Seneca’s method would suit
the historical dramatist who was not quite at home in his history, for
of local colour and visual detail it made small account, and indeed was
hardly compatible with them. And it would commend itself no less to men
of letters who, without much dramatic sympathy or aptitude, with no
knowledge of stage requirements, and little prospect of getting their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
pieces performed, felt called upon <i>honoris causâ</i> to write
dramas, which one of the most distinguished and successful among them
was candid enough to entitle not plays but treatises. It is worth while
to have a clear idea of the <i>Octavia</i> from which in right line
this illustrious and forgotten progeny proceeded.</p>

<p>The date of the action is supposed to be 62 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
when Nero, who had for some time wished to wed his mistress, Poppaea Sabina,
and had murdered his mother, partly on account of her opposition,
divorced his virtuous wife, his step-sister Octavia, and exiled her
to Pandataria, where shortly afterwards he had her put to death. The
fact that Seneca is one of the persons in the piece, and that there
are anticipatory references to Nero’s death, which followed Seneca’s
compulsory suicide only after an interval of three years, sufficiently
disposes of the theory that the philosopher himself was the author.</p>

<p>The text accepted in the sixteenth century suffered much, not only
from the corruption of individual expressions, but from the displacement
of entire passages. Greatly to its advantage it has been rearranged
by later editors, but in the following account, their conjectures,
generally happy and sometimes convincing, have been disregarded, as
they were unknown to Thomas Nuce, who rendered it into English in
1561. In his hands, therefore, it is more loosely connected than it
originally was, or than once more it has become for us; and something
of regularity it forfeits as well, for the dislocated framework led him
to regard it as a drama in only four acts. Despite these flaws in his
work he is a cleverer craftsman than many of his colleagues in Senecan
translation, whose versions of the ten tragedies, most of them already
published separately, were collected in a neat little volume in
1851.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">This programme the play proceeds to fill in.</p>

<p>In the first act Octavia, unbosoming herself to her nurse, relieves her
heart of its woe and horror. She recounts the misfortunes of her house,
the atrocities of her lord, his infidelities to her, her detestation
of him. The nurse is full of sympathy, but admonishes her to patience,
consoling her with assurances of the people’s love, and reminding her
of the truancies that the Empress of Heaven had also to excuse in her
own husband and brother:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
The chorus closes the act with a variation on the same themes, passing
from praises of Octavia’s purity and regrets for the ancient Roman
intolerance of wrong, to the contrasted picture of Nero’s unchallenged
malignity.</p>

<p>The second act commences with a monologue by Seneca on the growing
corruption of the age, which is interrupted by the approach of his
master in talk with the Prefect. His words, as he enters, are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dispatch with speede that we commaunded haue:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go, send forthwith some one or other slaue,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">May bring before our face: goe some man seeke.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Seneca remonstrates, but his remonstrances are
of no avail; and in a long discussion in which he advocates a policy
of righteousness and goodwill and the sacredness of Octavia’s claims,
he is equally unsuccessful. The act, to which there is no chorus,
concludes with Nero’s determination to flout the wishes of the people
and persist in the promotion of Poppaea:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Why do we not appoynt the morrow next</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When as our mariage pompe may be context?<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></div>
  </div></div></div>

<p>The third act is ushered in with one of those boding apparitions of
which the Senecan Tragedy is so fond. The shade of Agrippina rises, the
bridal torch of Nero and Poppaea in her hand:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
She bewails her crimes on her son’s behalf and his parricidal
ingratitude, but vengeance will fall on him at last.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Although that Tyrant proude and scornful wight</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Though troupes of soldiours, shielded sure, upholde</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their chieftaynes princely porch: and though yet still</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Unto his foes his bared throate restore.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">As she disappears, Octavia enters in conversation
with the chorus, whom she dissuades from the expression of sympathy for
her distress lest they should incur the wrath of the tyrant. On this
suggestion they denounce the supineness of the degenerate Romans in the
vindication of right, and exhort each other to an outbreak.</p>

<p>In the fourth act, Poppaea, terrified by an ominous dream of Nero
stabbing her first husband, and of Agrippina, a firebrand in her grasp,
leading her down through the earth, rushes across the stage, but is
stayed by her nurse, who soothes and encourages her, and bids her
return to her bridal chamber. Yet it seems as though her worst fears
were at once to be realised. The chorus, acknowledging the charms of
the new Empress, is interrupted by the hurried arrival of a messenger.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
He announces that the people are in uproar, overthrowing the statues of
Poppaea, and demanding the restitution of Octavia. But to what purpose?
The chorus sings that it is vain to oppose the resistless arms of love.
It is at least vain to oppose the arms of Nero’s soldiers. Confident in
their strength he enters, breathing forth threatenings and slaughter,
and expectant of a time when he will exact a full penalty from the citizens:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then shall their houses fall by force of fire;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Those villaines shall be sure to have ech day.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Dreaming of the future conflagration, he is
dissatisfied with the prefect, who tells him that the insurrection has
been easily quelled with the death of one or two, and meanwhile turns
all his wrath against the innocent cause of the riot. The play does
not, however, end with the murder of Octavia. She informs the chorus that
she is to be dispatched in Agrippina’s death-ship to her place of exile,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But now no helpe of death I feele,</div>

  </div></div></div>

<p>And the final song of the chorus, with a touch of dramatic irony,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
wishes her a prosperous voyage, and congratulates her on her removal
from the cruel city of Rome:</p>

<p>There could be no greater contrast than between <i>Appius and
Virginia</i>, with its exits and entrances, its changefulness and
bustle, its mixture of the pompous and the farcical; and the monotonous
declamation, the dismissal of all action, the meagreness of the
material in the <i>Octavia</i>. And yet they are more akin than they
at first sight appear. Disregard the buffoonery which the mongrel
“tragicall comedie” inherited from the native stock, and you perceive
traits that suggest another filiation. The similarity with the Latin
Play in its English version is, of course, misleading, except in so far
as it shows how the Senecan drama must present itself to an early
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
Elizabethan in the light of his own crude art. The devices of the
rhetorician were travestied by those who knew no difference between
rhetoric and rant, and whose very rant, whether they tried to invent
or to translate, was clumsy and strained. Hence the “tenne tragedies”
of Seneca and the nearly contemporary Mixed Plays have a strong family
resemblance in style. In all of them save the <i>Octavia</i> the
resemblance extends from diction to verse, for in dialogue and harangue
they employ the trailing fourteen-syllable measure of the popular
play, while in the <i>Octavia</i> this is discarded for the more
artistic heroic couplet. In this and other respects, T. N., as Nuce
signs himself, is undoubtedly more at his ease in the literary element
than others of the group; nevertheless he is often content to fly the
ordinary pitch of R. B. This is most obvious when their performances
are read and compared as a whole, but it is evident enough in single
passages. The Nurse, for example, says of Nero to Octavia:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Eft steppèd into servile Pallace stroke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To filthy vices lore one easly broke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Divelish wicked wit this Princocks proude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By stepdames wyle prince Claudius Sonne auoude;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whome deadly damme did bloudy match ylight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thee, against thy will, for feare did plight.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></div>
  </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">These words might almost suit the mouths of Appius
and his victims.</p>

<p>But leaving aside the affinities due to the common use of English
by writers on much the same plane of art, the London medley is not
immeasurably different from or inferior to the Roman <i>Praetexta</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
even when confronted with the latter in its native dress. In both the
characterisation is in the same rudimentary and obvious style, and
shows the same predilection for easily classified types. There is even
less genuine theatrical tact in the Latin than in the English drama.
The chief persons are under careful supervision and are kept rigidly
apart. Nero never meets Octavia or Poppaea, Poppaea and Octavia never
meet each other. No doubt there are some successful touches: the first
entrance of Nero is not ineffective; the equivocal hopefulness of the
last chorus is a thing one remembers: the insertion of Agrippina’s
prophecy and Poppaea’s dream does something to keep in view the future
requital and so to alleviate the thickening gloom. Except for these,
however, and a few other felicities natural to a writer with long
dramatic traditions behind him, the <i>Octavia</i> strikes us as a
series of disquisitions and discussions, well-arranged, well-managed,
often effective, sometimes brilliant, that have been suggested by a
single impressive historical situation.</p>

<h4 id="SENECANS">2. THE FRENCH SENECANS</h4>

<p>These salient features are transmitted to the Senecan dramas of France,
except that the characterisation is even vaguer, the declamation
ampler, and the whole treatment less truly dramatic and more obviously
rhetorical; of which there is an indication in the greater relative
prominence of monologue as compared with dialogue, and in the excessive
predilection for general reflections,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> many of them derived from
Seneca and Horace, but many of them too of modern origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
At the head of the list stands the <i>Julius Caesar</i> of Muretus, a
play which, even if of far less intrinsic worth than can be claimed for
it, would always be interesting for the associations with which it is
surrounded.</p>

<p>Montaigne, after mentioning among his other tutors “Marc Antoine
Muret,” que le France et l’Italie recognoist pour le meilleur orateur
du temps, goes on to tell us: “J’ay soustenu les premiers personnages
ez tragedies latines de Buchanan, de Guerente et de Muret, qui se
representerent en nostre college de Guienne avecques dignité: en cela,
Andreas Goveanus, nostre principal, comme en toutes aultres parties de
sa charge, feut sans comparaison le plus grand principal de France; et
m’en tenoit on maistre ouvrier.”</p>

<p>The <i>Julius Caesar</i> written in 1544 belongs to the year before
Montaigne left Bordeaux at the age of thirteen, so he may have taken
one of the chief parts in it, Caesar, or M. Brutus, or Calpurnia. This
would always give us a kind of personal concern in Muret’s short boyish
composition of barely 600 lines, which he wrote at the age of eighteen
and afterwards published only among his <i>Juvenilia</i>. But it has
an importance of its own. Of course it is at the best an academic
experiment, though from Montaigne’s statement that these plays were
presented “avecques dignité,” and from the interest the principal took
in the matter, we may suppose that the performance would be exemplary
in its kind. Of course, too, even as an academic experiment it does
not, to modern taste, seem on the level of the more elaborate tragedies
which George Buchanan, “ce grand poëte ecossois,” as Montaigne
reverently styles his old preceptor, had produced at the comparatively
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
mature age of from thirty-three to thirty-six, ere leaving Bordeaux
two years before. It is inferior to the <i>Baptistes</i> and far
inferior to the <i>Jephthes</i> in precision of portraiture and pathos
of appeal. But in the sixteenth century, partly, no doubt, because
the subject was of such secular importance and the treatment so
congenial to learned theory, but also, no doubt, because the eloquence
was sometimes so genuinely eloquent, and the Latin, despite a few
licenses in metre and grammar, so racy of the classic soil, it obtained
extraordinary fame and exercised extraordinary influence. For these
reasons, as well as the additional one that it is now less widely known
than it ought to be, a brief account of it may not be out of place.</p>

<p>The first act is entirely occupied with a soliloquy by Caesar, in which
he represents himself as having attained the summit of earthly glory.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Let others at their pleasure count their
triumphs, and name themselves from vanquished provinces. It is more to
be called Caesar: whoso seeks fresh titles elsewhere, takes something
away thereby. Would you have me reckon the regions conquered under my
command? Enumerate all there are.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">Even Rome has yielded to him, even his great son-in-law
admitted his power,</p>

<p class="blockquot">and whom he would not have as an equal, he has borne
as a superior.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">What more is to be done?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">My quest must be heaven, earth is become base
to me.... Now long enough have I lived whether for myself or for my
country.... The destruction of foes, the gift of laws to the people,
the ordering of the year, the restoration of splendour to worship, the
settlement of the world,—than these, greater things can be conceived by
none, nor pettier be performed by me.... When life has played the part
assigned to it, death never comes in haste and sometimes too
late.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">The chorus sings of the immutability of fortune.</p>

<p>In the second act Brutus, in a long monologue, upbraids himself with
his delay.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Does the virtue of thy house move thee nought,
and nought the name of Brutus? Nought, the hard lot of thy groaning
country, crushed by the tyrant and calling for thine aid? Nought the
petitions in which the people lament that Brutus comes not to champion
the state? If these things fail to touch thee, thy wife now gives thee
rede enough that thou be a man; who has pledged her faith to thee in
blood, thus avouching herself the offspring of thine
uncle.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">He raises and meets the objections which his
understanding offers:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Say you he is not king but dictator? If the thing
be the same, what boots a different name? Say you he shuns that name,
and rejects the crowns they proffer him: this is pretence and mockery,
for why then did he remove the tribunes? True, he gave me dignities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
and once my life; with me my country outweighs them all. Whoso shows
gratitude to a tyrant against his country’s interest, is ingrate while
he seeks to be stupidly grateful.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">And his conclusion is</p>

<p class="blockquot">The sun reawakening to life saw the people
under the yoke, and slaves: at his setting may he see them
free.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">To him enters Cassius exultant that the day has
arrived, impatient for the decisive moment, scarce able to restrain
his eagerness. Only one scruple remains to him; should Antony be slain
along with his master? Brutus answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent5">Often already have I said that my purpose is this,</div>
<div class="verse indent5">to destroy tyranny but save the citizens.</div>

<div class="verse indent0"><i>Cass.</i> Then let it be destroyed from its deepest roots,</div>
<div class="verse indent5">lest if only cut down, it sprout again at some time hereafter.</div>

<div class="verse indent0"><i>Brut.</i> The whole root lurks under a single trunk.</div>

<div class="verse indent0"><i>Cass.</i> Think’st thou so? I shall say no more. Thy will</div>
<div class="verse indent5">be done: we all follow thy guidance.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The chorus sings the glories of those who, like Harmodius with his
“amiculus,” destroy the tyrants, and the risks these tyrants run.</p>

<p>In the third act Calpurnia, flying in panic to her chamber, is met by
her nurse, to whom she discloses the cause of her distress. She has
dreamed that Caesar lies dead in her arms covered with blood, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
stabbed with many wounds. The nurse points out the vanity of dreams and
the unlikelihood of any attempt against one so great and beneficent,
whose clemency has changed even foes to friends. Calpurnia, only half
comforted, rejoins that she will at least beseech him to remain at home
that day, and the chorus prays that misfortune may be averted.</p>

<p>In the fourth act Calpurnia tries her powers of persuasion. To her
passionate appeal, her husband answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent7">What? Dost thou ask me to trust thy dreams?</div>
    <div class="verse indent3"><i>Cal.</i> No; but to concede something to my fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Caes.</i> But that fear of thine rests on dreams alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent3"><i>Cal.</i> Assume it to be vain; grant something to thy wife.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">She goes on to enumerate the warning portents, and
at length Caesar assents to her prayers since she cannot repress her
terrors. But here Decimus Brutus strikes in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">High-hearted Caesar,
              what word has slipped from thee?<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He bids him remember his glory:</p>

<p class="blockquot">O most shameful plight if the world is ruled
by Caesar and Caesar by a woman.... What, Caesar, dost thou suppose
the Fathers will think if thou bidst them, summoned at thy command,
to depart now and to return when better dreams present themselves to
Calpurnia. Go rather resolutely and assume a name the Parthians must
dread: or if this please thee not, at least go forth, and thyself
dismiss the Fathers; let them not think they are slighted and had in
derision.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>Caesar is bent one way by pity for his wife, another by fear of these
taunts; but, at last, leaving Calpurnia to her misgivings, he exclaims:</p>

<p class="blockquot">But yet, since even to fall, so it be but once,
is better than to be laden with lasting fear; not if three hundred
prophet-voices call me back, not if with his own voice the present
Deity himself warn me of the peril and urge my staying here, shall I
refrain.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">The chorus cites the predictions of Cassandra to
show that it would sometimes be wise to follow the counsel of women.</p>

<p>In the fifth act Brutus and Cassius appear in triumph.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="neg-indent"><i>Brut.</i> Breathe, citizens; Caesar
is slain!... In the Senate which he erewhile overbore, he lies
overborne.</p>

<p class="neg-indent"><i>Cass.</i> Behold, Rome, the sword yet warm
with blood, behold the hand that hath championed thine honour. That
loathsome one who in impious frenzy and blind rage had troubled thee
and thine, sore wounded by this same hand, by this same sword which
thou beholdest, and gashed in every limb, hath spewed forth his life
in a flood of gore.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">As they leave, Calpurnia enters bewailing the
truth of her dream, and inviting to share in her laments the chorus,
which denounces vengeance on the criminals. Then the voice of Caesar is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
heard in rebuke of their tears and in comfort of their distress. Only
his shadow fell, but he himself is joined to the immortals.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Weep no more: it is the wretched that tears
befit. Those who assailed me with frantic mind—a god am I, and true
is my prophecy—shall not escape vengeance for their deed. My sister’s
grandson, heir of my virtue as of my sceptre, will require the penalty
as seems good to him.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">Calpurnia recognises the voice, and the chorus
celebrates the bliss of the “somewhat” that is released from the prison
house of the body.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Muretus already employs a number of the
<i>motifs</i> that reappear in Shakespeare. Thus he gives prominence to
the self-conscious magnanimity of Caesar: to the temporary hesitation
of Brutus, with his appeal to his name and the letters that are placed
in his way; to his admiration for the courage and constancy of Portia;
to his final whole-heartedness and disregard of Caesar’s love for him;
to his prohibition of Mark Antony’s death; to Cassius’ vindictive zeal
and eager solicitation of his friend; to Calpurnia’s dream, and the
contest between her and Decimus Brutus and in Caesar’s own mind; to
Caesar’s fatal decision in view of his honour, and his rejection of
the fear of death; to the exultation of Brutus and Cassius as they
enter with their blood-stained swords after the deed is done. And more
noticeable than any of these details, are the divided admiration and
divided sympathy the author bestows both on Brutus and Caesar—which
are obvious even in the wavering utterances of the chorus. We are far
removed from the times when Dante saw Lucifer devouring Brutus and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Cassius in two of his mouths with Judas between them; or when Chaucer,
making a composite monster of the pair, tells how “false
Brutus-Cassius,”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That ever hadde of his hye state envye,”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">“stikede” Julius with “boydekins.” But we are
equally far from the times when Marie-Joseph Chénier was to write his
tragedy of <i>Brutus et Cassius, Les Derniers Romains</i>. At the
renaissance the characteristic feeling was enthusiasm for Caesar and
his assassin alike, though it was Shakespeare alone who knew how to
reconcile the two points of view.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Of the admiration which Muret’s little drama excited there is
documentary proof. Prefixed to it are a number of congratulatory
verses, and among the eulogists are not only scholars, like
Buchanan,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> but literary men, members of the Pléiade—Dorât, Baïf,
and especially Jodelle, who has his complimentary conceits on the
appropriateness of the author’s name, Mark Antony, to the feat he has
accomplished.</p>

<p>But this last testimony leads us to the less explicit but not less
obvious indications of the influence exercised by Muret’s tragedy which
appear in the subsequent story of literary production. This influence
was both indirect and direct. The example of this modern Latin play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
could not but count for something when Jodelle took the further step
of treating another Roman theme in the vernacular. In the vernacular,
too, Grévin was inspired to rehandle the same theme as Muretus,
obtaining from his predecessor most of his material and his apparatus.
These experiments again were not without effect on the later dramas of
Garnier, two of which were to leave a mark on English literature.</p>

<p>The first regular tragedy as well as the first Roman history in the
French language was the <i>Cléopatre Captive</i> of Jodelle, acted
with great success in 1552 before Henry II. by Jodelle’s friends, who
at the subsequent banquet presented to him, in semi-pagan wise, a goat
decked with flowers and ivy. The prologue<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to the King describes the
contents.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But this programme conveys an impression of
greater variety and abundance than is justified by the piece. In
point of fact it begins only after the death of Antony, who does not
intervene save as a ghost in the opening scene, to bewail his offences
and announce that in a dream he has bid Cleopatra join him before the
day is out.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Nor do we hear anything of “desirs et flammes” on his part; rather he
resents her seductions, and has summoned her to share his torments:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">Qui s’est faite longtemps compagne en ma liesse.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The sequel does little more than describe how his command
is carried out. Cleopatra enters into conversation with Eras and Charmium, and
despite their remonstrances resolves to obey. The chorus sings of the
fickleness of fortune: (Act <span class="allsmcap">i.</span>). Octavianus, after a passing
regret for Antony, arranges with Proculeius and Agrippa to make sure of
her presence at his triumph. The chorus sings of the perils of pride:
(Act <span class="smcap">ii.</span>). Octavianus visits the Queen, dismisses her excuses,
but grants mercy to her and her children, and pardons her deceit when
her retention of her jewellery is exposed by Seleucus. But Seleucus is
inconsolable for his offence as well as his castigation, and exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lors que la royne, et triste et courageuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Devant Cesar aux chevaux m’a tiré,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Que l’eternelle et mordante pointure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui jà desjà jusques au fond me blesse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">D’avoir blessé ma royne et ma maistresse.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The chorus oddly enough discovers in her maltreatment of the
tale-bearer a proof of her indomitable spirit, and an indication
that she will never let herself be led to Rome: (Act <span class="smcap">iii.</span>).
Cleopatra now explains that her submission was only feigned to secure
the lives of her children, and that she herself has no thought of
following the conqueror’s car. Eras and Charmium approve, and all
three depart to Antony’s tomb to offer there a last sacrifice, which
the chorus describes in full detail: (Act <span class="smcap">iv.</span>). Proculeius in
consternation announces the sequel:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“J’ay veu (ô rare et miserable chose!)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ma Cleopatre en son royal habit</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Peint et doré, blesme et morte couchée,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tombe a l’envers, restans un tronc humain.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The chorus celebrates the pitifulness and glory
of her end, and the supremacy of Caesar: (Act <i>V.</i>).</p>

<p>Thus, despite the promises of the prologue, the play resolves itself to
a single <i>motif</i>, the determination of Cleopatra to follow Antony
in defiance of Octavianus’ efforts to prevent her. Nevertheless, simple
as it is, it fails in real unity. The ghost of Antony, speaking, one
must suppose, the final verdict, pronounces condemnation on her as
well as himself; yet in the rest of the play, even in the undignified
episode with Seleucus, Jodelle bespeaks for her not only our sympathy
but our admiration. It is just another aspect of this that Antony
treats her death as the beginning of her punishment, but to her and her
attendants and the women of Alexandria it is a desirable release. The
recurrent theme of the chorus, varied to suit the complexion of the
different acts, is always the same:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Joye, qui dueil enfante</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Se meurdrist; puis la mort,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Par la joye plaisante,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fait au deuil mesme tort.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Half a dozen years later, in 1558, the <i>Confrères de la Passion</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
were acting a play which Muretus had more immediately prompted, and
which did him greater credit. This was the <i>Cesar</i> of Jacques
Grévin, a young Huguenot gentlemen who, at the age of twenty, recast in
French the even more juvenile effort of the famous scholar, expanding
it to twice the size, introducing new personages, giving the old ones
more to do, and while borrowing largely in language and construction,
shaping it to his own ends and making it much more dramatic. Indeed,
his tragedy strikes one as fitter for the popular stage than almost
any other of its class, and this seems to have been felt at the time,
for besides running through two editions in 1561 and 1562, it was
reproduced by the <i>Confrères</i> with great success in the former
year. Of course its theatrical merit is only relative, and it does not
escape the faults of the Senecan school. Grévin styles his <i>dramatis
personae</i> rather ominously and very correctly “entre-parleurs”; for
they talk rather than act. They talk, moreover, in long, set harangues
even when they are conversing, and Grévin so likes to hear them that he
sometimes lets the story wait. Nor do they possess much individuality
or concrete life. But the young author has passion; he has fire; and he
knows the dramatic secret of contrasting different moods and points of view.</p>

<p>He follows his exemplar most closely, and often literally, in the
first three acts, though even in them he often goes his own way. Thus,
after Caesar’s opening soliloquy, which is by no means so Olympian
as in Muret, he introduces Mark Antony, who encourages his master
with reminders of his greatness and assurances of his devotion. In
the second act, after Marcus Brutus’ monologue, not only Cassius but
Decimus has something to say, and there is a quicker interchange of
statement and rejoinder than is usual in such a play. In the third act,
the third and fourth of Muretus are combined, and after the conversation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
of Calpurnia with the Nurse, there follow her attempts to dissuade
her husband from visiting the senate house, the hesitation of Caesar,
the counter-arguments of Decimus; and in conclusion, when Decimus has
prevailed, the Nurse resumes her endeavours at consolation. The fourth
act is entirely new, and gives an account of the assassination by the
mouth of a Messenger, who is also a new person, to the distracted
Calpurnia and her sympathetic Nurse. In the fifth Grévin begins by
returning to his authority in the jubilant speeches of Brutus and
Cassius, but one by Decimus is added; and rejecting the expedient of
the ghostly intervention, he substitutes, much more effectively, that
of Mark Antony, who addresses the chorus of soldiers, rouses them to
vengeance, and having made sure of them, departs to stir up the people.</p>

<p>Altogether a creditable performance, and a distinct improvement on the
more famous play that supplied the groundwork. One must not be misled
by the almost literal discipleship of Grévin in particular passages, to
suppose that even in language he is a mere imitator. The discipleship
is of course undeniable. Take Brutus’ outburst:</p>

<p class="no-indent">But generally Grévin is more abundant and more
fervid even when he reproduces most obviously, and among the best of
his purple patches are some that are quite his own. He indeed thought
differently. He modestly confesses:</p>

<p class="no-indent">All the same there is nothing in Muretus like the

<p>Grévin’s tragedy had great vogue, was preferred even to those of
Jodelle, and was praised by Ronsard, though Ronsard afterwards
retracted his praises when Grévin broke with him on religious grounds.
His protestantism, however, would be a recommendation rather than
otherwise in England, and one would like to know whether some of
the lost English pieces on the same subject owed anything to the
French drama. The suggestion has even been made that Shakespeare was
acquainted with it. There are some vague resemblances in particular

<p class="no-indent">Herr Collischonn also draws attention to a
coincidence in situation that is not derived from Plutarch. When the
conspirators are discussing the chances of Caesar’s attending the

<p class="no-indent">It is at least curious to find the same sort of addition,
in the same circumstances and with the same speakers in Shakespeare.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p class="no-indent">Such <i>minutiae</i>, however, are far from conclusive,
especially since, as in the two instances quoted, which are the most significant,
Plutarch, though he did not authorise, may at any rate have suggested
them. The first looks like an expansion of Caesar’s remark when his
friends were discussing which death was the best: “Death unlooked for.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
The second follows as a natural dramatic anticipation of the part that
Decimus actually played in inducing Caesar to keep tryst. They may
very well have occurred independently to both poets; or, if there be
a connection, may have been transmitted from the older to the younger
through the medium of some forgotten English piece. There is more
presumptive evidence that Grévin influenced the <i>Julius Caesar</i>
of Sir William Alexander, Earl of Stirling; but Stirling’s paraphrase
of his authorities is so diffuse that they are not always easy to
trace. His apparent debts to Grévin may really be due to the later
and much more famous French Senecan Garnier, two of whose works have
an undoubted though not very conspicuous place in the history of the
English Drama generally, and especially of the Roman Play in England.</p>

<p><i>Cornélie</i>, the earlier and less successful of the pair, written
in Garnier’s twenty-eighth year, was performed at the Hôtel de
Bourgogne in 1573, and was published in 1574. The young author was not
altogether unpractised in his art, for already in 1568 he had written
a drama on the subject of Portia, but he has not yet advanced beyond
his predecessors, and like them, or perhaps more obviously than they,
is at the stage of regarding the tragedy “only as an elegy mixed with
rhetorical expositions.” The episode that he selected lent itself to
such treatment.</p>

<p>Cornelia, the daughter of Metellus Scipio, had after the loss of her
first husband, the younger Cassius, become the wife of Pompey the
Great, of whose murder she was an eye-witness. Meanwhile her father
still made head against Caesar in Africa, and the play deals with her
regrets and suspense at Rome till she learns the issue of this final
struggle. In the first act Cicero soliloquises on the woes of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
country, which he traces to her lust of conquest; and the chorus takes
up the burden at the close. In the second Cornelia bewails her own
miseries, which she attributes to her infidelity in marrying again:
Cicero tries to comfort her and she refuses his comfort, both in very
long harangues; and the chorus describes the mutability of mortal
things. In the third act she narrates an ominous dream in which the
shade of Pompey has visited her. Scarcely has she left the stage when
Cicero enters to announce the triumph of Caesar and the death of
Scipio. Cornelia re-enters to receive the urn with Pompey’s ashes, the
sight of which stirs her to new laments for herself and imprecations
against Caesar. The chorus dwells on the capriciousness of fortune. In
the fourth act the resentment against Caesar is emphasised by Cassius
in discourse with Decimus Brutus, and the chorus sings of Harmodios and
Aristogeiton; but after that Caesar and Antony come in and discuss the
means to be taken for Caesar’s safety, Antony advocating severity and
caution, Caesar leniency and confidence. This act is closed by a chorus
of Caesar’s friends, who celebrate his services and virtues. The fifth
act is chiefly occupied with the messenger’s account of Scipio’s last
battle and death, at the end of which Cornelia at some length declares
that when she has paid due funeral rites to husband and father, she
will surrender her own life.</p>

<p>From this analysis it will be seen that <i>Cornélie</i> as a play
is about as defective as it could be. The subject is essentially
undramatic, for the heroine—and there is no hero—has nothing to do
but spend her time in lamentations and forebodings, in eulogies and
vituperations. Yet the subject is more suitable than the treatment.
There is no trace of conflict, internal or external; for the persons
maintain their own point of view throughout, and the issue is a matter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
of course from the first. There is no entanglement or plot; but all
the speakers, as they enter in turn, are affected with a craving to
deliver their minds either in solitude or to some congenial listener:
and their prolations lead to nothing. Even the unity of interest, which
the classicists so prized, and over-prized, is lacking here, despite
the bareness of the theme. Cicero has hardly less to say than Cornelia,
and in two acts she does not so much as appear, while in one of them
attention is diverted from her sorrows to the dangers of Caesar. The
heroine no doubt retains a certain kind of primacy, but save for that,
M. Faguet’s description would be literally correct: “The piece in the
author’s conception might be entitled <i>Thoughts of various persons
concerning Rome at the Date of Thapsus</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
The <i>Cornélie</i> is by no means devoid of merit, but that merit
is almost entirely rhetorical, literary, and poetical. The language
is never undignified, the metres are carefully manipulated; the
descriptions and reflections, many of them taken from Lucan, though
sometimes stilted, are often elevated and picturesque. But the most
dramatic passages are the conversations in the fourth act, where the
<i>inter-locuteurs</i>, as Garnier calls the characters with even more
reason than Grévin calls those of his play <i>entre-parleurs</i>, are
respectively Decimus Brutus and Cassius, Caesar and Mark Antony: and
this is typical for two reasons. In the first place, these scenes
have least to do with the titular subject, and are, as it were, mere
excrescences on the main theme. In the second place, they are borrowed,
so far as their general idea is concerned, from Grévin, as Grévin
in turn had borrowed them from Muretus; and even details have been
transmitted to the cadet in the trinity from each and both of his
predecessors. Thus in the <i>Cornélie</i> Decimus not very suitably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
replaces or absorbs Marcus Brutus, but the whole tone and movement of
the interview with Cassius are the same in all the three plays, and
particular expressions reappear in Garnier that are peculiar to one or
other of his elder colleagues or that the later has adapted from the
earlier. For example, Garnier’s Cassius describes Caesar as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">un homme effeminé</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui le Roy Nicomede a jeune butiné.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There is no express reference to this scandal in
Muretus, but it furnishes Grévin’s Decimus with a vigorous couplet
which obviously has inspired the above quotation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">N’endurons plus sur nous regner un Ganimede</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et la moitié du lict de son Roy Nicomede.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here, on the other hand, is an instance of Garnier
getting a phrase from Muretus that Grévin passed over. Decimus says in
excuse of his former patron:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Encor’ n’est il pas Roy portant le diadême:</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">to which Cassius replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Non, il est Dictateur: et n’est-ce pas de mesme?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In the Latin both objection and answer are put in the lips
of Marcus Brutus, but that does not affect the resemblance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At vero non rex iste, sed dictator est.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dum res sit una, quid aliud nomen juvat?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In other cases the parallelism is threefold.
Thus Garnier’s Cassius exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Les chevaux courageux ne maschent point le mors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sujets au Chevalier qu’avecque grands efforts;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Qu’à force, pour paistrir les plaines labourables.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nous hommes, nous Romains, ayant le coeur plus mol,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sous un joug volontaire irons ployer le col.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
Grévin’s Marcus Brutus said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Le taureau, le cheval ne prestent le col bas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A l’appetit d’un joug, si ce n’est pas contraincte:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fauldra il donc que Rome abbaisse sous la craincte</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">De ce nouveau tyran le chef de sa grandeur?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In Muretus the same personage puts it more shortly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Generosiores frena detrectant equi:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nec nisi coacti perferunt tauri jugum:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Roma patietur, quod recusant belluae.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In the scene between Caesar and Antony the
resemblances are less marked in detail, partly owing to the somewhat
different role assigned to the second speaker, but they are there; and
the general tendency, from the self-conscious monologue of Caesar with
which it opens, to the dialogue in which he gives expression to his
doubts, is practically the same in both plays.</p>

<p>And these episodes are of some importance in view of their subsequent
as well as their previous history. Though neither entirely original
nor entirely relevant, they seem, perhaps because of their comparative
fitness for the stage, to have made a great impression at the time.
It has been suggested that they were not without their influence on
Shakespeare when he came to write his <i>Julius Caesar</i>: a point the
discussion of which may be reserved. It is certain that they supplied
Alexander, though he may also have used Grévin and even Muretus, with
the chief models and materials for certain scenes in his tragedy on the
same subject. Thus, he too presents Caesar and Antony in consultation,
and the former prefaces this interchange of views with a high-flown
declaration of his greatness. Thus, too, the substance of their talk
is to a great extent adapted from Garnier and diluted in the process.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Compare the similar versions of the apology that Caesar makes for his
action. In Alexander he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The highest in the heaven who knows all hearts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do know my thoughts as pure as are their starres,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that (constrain’d) I came from forraine parts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To seeme uncivill in the civill warres.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I mov’d that warre which all the world bemoanes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whil’st urged by force to free my selfe from feares;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still when my hand gave wounds, my heart gave groanes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No Romans bloud was shed, but I shed teares.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is very like what Garnier’s Caesar says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">J’atteste Jupiter qui sonne sur la terre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Que contraint malgré moy j’ay mené ceste guerre:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et que victoire aucune où j’apperçoy gesir</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Le corps d’un citoyen, ne me donne plaisir:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mais de mes ennemis l’envie opiniatre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et le malheur Romain m’a contraint de combattre.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So, too, when Antony asserts that some are contriving
Caesar’s death, the speakers engage in a dialectical skirmish:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Caesar.</i> The best are bound to me by gifts in store.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Antony.</i> But to their countrey they are bound farre more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Caesar.</i> Then loathe they me as th’ enemy of the state?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Antony.</i> Who freedom love, you (as usurper) hate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Caesar.</i> I by great battells have enlarg’d their bounds.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Antony.</i> By that they think your pow’r too much abounds.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The filiation with Garnier is surely unmistakable,
though it cannot be shown in every line or phrase.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Antoine.</i> Aux ennemis domtez il n’y a point de foy.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Cesar.</i> En ceux qui vie et biens de ma bonté reçoivent?</div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Antoine.</i> Rome ne peut souffrir commandement de Princes.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The scene with the conspirators Stirling treats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
very differently and much more freely. It had had, as we have seen,
a peculiar history. In Muretus it was confined to Marcus Brutus and
Cassius, in Grévin Decimus Brutus is added, in Garnier Decimus is
retained and Marcus drops out. Alexander discriminates. He keeps one
discussion for Marcus and Cassius, in so far restoring it to the
original and more fitting form it had obtained from Muretus, though he
transfers to Marcus some of the sentiments that Garnier had assigned
to Decimus. But the half-apologetic rôle that Decimus plays in Garnier
had impressed him, and he did not choose to forego the spice of variety
which this contributed. So he invents a new scene for him in which
Cicero takes the place of Cassius and solicits his support. But though
the one episode is thus cut in two, and each of the halves enlarged
far beyond the dimensions of the original whole, it is unquestionable
that they owe their main suggestion and much of their matter to the <i>Cornélie</i>.</p>

<p>Since then Garnier, when his powers were still immature, could so
effectively adapt these incidental passages, it is not surprising that
he should by and by be able to stand alone, and produce plays in which
the central interest was more dramatic.</p>

<p>Of these we are concerned only with <i>Marc Antoine</i>, which was
acted with success at the Hôtel de Bourgogne in 1578, and was printed
in the same year. In it Garnier has not altogether freed himself from
his former faults. There are otiose personages who are introduced
merely to supply general reflections: Diomedes, the secretary, on
the pathos of Cleopatra’s fall; Philostratus, the philosopher, on
the overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy. There is no interaction
of character on character, all the protagonists being so carefully
excluded from each other that Octavianus does not meet Antony, Antony
does not meet Cleopatra, Cleopatra does not meet Octavianus. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
speeches are still over long, and the “sentences” over abundant.
Nevertheless there is a real story, there are real characters; and the
story and characters admit, or rather demand, an effective alternation
of passion.</p>

<p>The time comprises the interval between Antony’s final reverse and
the suicide of Cleopatra: it is short, but a good deal longer than
what Jodelle allowed himself in the companion play. Further, the
situation is much more complex and less confined, so that Garnier,
while borrowing many <i>motifs</i> from Jodelle, or from their common
authority, Plutarch, is able to avoid the monotony of <i>Cléopatre
Captive</i>. Nor does the coherence suffer. It is true that the account
of Antony’s death, announced by Dercetas, occurs as with Shakespeare in
the fourth act; but the play is rightly named after him and not after
the Queen. He is the principal and by far the most interesting figure,
and it is his tragic fate to which all that precedes leads up, and
which determines all that follows.</p>

<p>The first act, as so often in these Senecan plays, is entirely
occupied with a soliloquy, which Antony declaims; but even this has
a certain share of dramatic life, though rather after the fashion of
a dramatic lyric than of a dramatic scene. He rages against what he
supposes to be the crowning perfidy of his mistress, he recalls all
that his infatuation has cost him; the worst of his woes is that they
are caused by her; but he must love her still. The second act has at
the opening and the close respectively the unnecessary monologues of
Philostratus and Diomedes, but they serve as setting for the animated
and significant conversation between Cleopatra and her women. From it
we learn that of the final treason at least she is innocent, but she is
full of remorse for the mischief that her love and her caprices have
done, and determines, despite the claims of her children, to expiate it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
in death. Then, entering the monument she despatches Diomedes with her
excuses to Antony. To him we return in the third act, which is central
in interest as in position, and we hear him disburden his soul to his
friend Lucilius. His fluctuations of feeling, shame at his undoing,
passion for the fair undoer, jealousy lest his conqueror should supplant
him in love as in empire, are delineated with sympathetic power:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Now it only remains for him to die. In the fourth act
Octavianus dwells on the arduousness of his triumphs and the enormity of
Antony’s offences, in order to justify a ruthless policy; and a discussion
follows between him and Agrippa, like the one between Julius and Antony
in the <i>Cornélie</i>, except that here the emperor and his adviser
have their parts reversed. When his resolution seems fixed Dercetas
enters in dismay with tidings that Antony has sought to take his own
life, and that mortally wounded he has been drawn up into the monument
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
to breathe his last in Cleopatra’s arms. For a moment his conqueror’s
heart is touched. But only for a moment. He speedily gives ear to the
warning of Agrippa, that to secure her treasures and preserve her life,
Cleopatra must be seized. In the fifth act she has all her preparations
made to follow her lord. In vain Euphron tries to stay her by gathering

“THE WOUNDS OF CIVIL WAR”</h4>

<p>The <i>Marc Antoine</i> is the best tragedy on a Roman theme, and one
of the best imitations of Seneca that France in the sixteenth century
has to show. It deserved to find admirers on the other side of the
Channel, and it did. Among the courtly and cultured circles in whose
eyes the Latin drama was the ideal and criterion to which all poets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
should aspire and by which their achievements should be tested, it was
bound to call forth no little enthusiasm. In England ere this similar
attempts had been made and welcomed, but none had been quite so moving
and interesting, above all none had conformed so strictly to the formal
requirements of the humanist code. In <i>Gorboduc</i>, the first of
these experiments, Sidney, lawgiver of the elect, was pleased to admit
the “honest civility” and “skilful poetry,” but his praises were not
without qualification:</p>

<p class="blockquot">As it is full of stately speeches and well
sounding Phrases, clyming to the height of Seneca his stile, and as
full of notable moralitie, which it doth most delightfully teach, and
so obtayne the very end of Poesie: yet in troth it is very defectious
in the circumstaunces: which greeveth mee, because it might not remaine
as an exact model of all Tragedies. For it is faulty both in place, and
time, the two necessary companions of all corporall actions. For where
the stage should alwaies represent but one place, and the uttermost
time presupposed in it, should be, both by Aristotles precept, and
common reason, but one day: there is both many dayes, and many places,
inartificially imagined.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Nor in such respects were things much better in the <i>Misfortunes of
Arthur</i>, by Thomas Hughes, which was composed in 1587, the year
after Sidney’s death. But meanwhile France had been blessed with a
play at least the equal of these native products in poetry and pathos,
and much more observant of the unities that scholars were proclaiming.
If the scene was not absolutely unchanged, at least the changes
were confined within the area of a single town. If the time was not
precisely marked, and in Plutarch’s narrative slightly exceeded the
orthodox limits, still Garnier had so managed it that the occurrences
set forth might easily be conceived to take place in a single day. It
seems just the modern play that would have fulfilled the desire of
Sidney’s heart; and since it was composed in a foreign tongue, what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
could be more fitting than that Sidney’s sister, the famous Countess
of Pembroke, who shared so largely in Sidney’s literary tastes and
literary gifts, should undertake to give it an English form? It
may have been on her part a pious offering to his <i>manes</i>,
and in 1590, four years after her brother’s death, her version was
complete.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
She was well fitted for her task, and she has discharged it well.
Sometimes she may take her liberties, but generally she is wonderfully
faithful, and yet neither in diction nor versification is she stiffer
than many contemporary writers of original English verse. Here, for
instance, is Diomed’s eulogy of Cleopatra’s charm:</p>

<p class="no-indent">The most notable privilege of which the
translation makes use is to soften or refine certain expressions that
may have seemed too vigorous to the high-bred English lady. This, for
example, is her rendering of the lines already quoted in which Antony
denounces his voluptuous life:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="no-indent">Similarly, in Cleopatra’s closing speech, the
original expression, “mon ame vomissant,” yields to a gentler and not
less poetical equivalent:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A thousand kisses, thousand thousand more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let you my mouth for honor’s farewell give:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fainting on you, and fourth <i>my soule may flowe</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">As the deviations are confined to details, it is not necessary
to repeat the account of the tragedy as a whole. These extracts will show
that Garnier’s <i>Marc Antoine</i> was presented to the English public
in a worthy dress; and the adequacy of the workmanship, the appeal to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
cultivated taste, the prestige of the great Countess as “Sidney’s
sister, Pembroke’s mother,” her personal reputation among literary men,
procured it immediate welcome and lasting acceptance. Fifteen years
after its first publication it had passed through five editions, and
must have been a familiar book to Elizabethan readers who cared for
such wares. Moreover, it directly evoked an original English play that
followed in part the same pattern and treated in part the same theme.</p>

<p>In 1594 appeared the <i>Cleopatra</i> of Samuel Daniel, dedicated to
Lady Pembroke with very handsome acknowledgments of the stimulus he
had received from her example and with much modest deprecation of the
supplement he offered. His muse, he asserts, would not have digressed
from the humble task of praising Delia,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">had not thy well graced Antony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Who all alone, having remained long)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Requir’d his Cleopatra’s company.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">These words suggest that it was not written at once
after the Countess’s translation: on the other hand there can have been
no very long delay, as it was entered for publication in October, 1593.
The first complete and authorised edition of <i>Delia</i> along with
the <i>Complaint of Rosamond</i>, which Daniel does not mention,
had been given to the world in 1592; and we may assume from his own
words that the <i>Cleopatra</i> was the next venture of the young
author just entering his thirties, and ambitious of a graver kind of
fame than he had won by these amatorious exercises. He had no reason
to be dissatisfied with the result, and perhaps from the outset his
self-disparagement was not very genuine. His play was reprinted seven
times before his death, and these editions show one complete revision
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and one thorough recast of the text. Poets are not wont to spend
such pains on works that they do not value. The truth is that
Daniel’s <i>Cleopatra</i> may take its place beside his subsequent
<i>Philotas</i> among the best original Senecan tragedies that
Elizabethan England produced. Its claims, of course, are almost
exclusively literary and hardly at all theatrical, though some of
the changes in the final version of 1607 seem meant to give a little
mobility to the slow-paced scenes. But from first to last it depends
on the elegiac and rhetorical qualities that characterise the whole
school, and in its undivided attention to them recalls rather Jodelle’s
<i>Cléopatre Captive</i> than Garnier’s <i>Marc Antoine</i>. The
resemblance to the earlier drama is perhaps not accidental. The
situation is precisely the same, for the story begins after the death
of Antony, and concludes with the account of Cleopatra’s suicide. Thus,
despite Daniel’s statement, his play is not in any true sense a sequel
to the one which the Countess had rendered, nor is it the case, as his
words insinuate, that in the <i>Antonius</i> Cleopatra still delayed
to join her beloved: on the contrary we take leave of her as she is
about to expire upon his corpse. So though his patroness’s translation
may very well have suggested to him his heroine, it could not possibly
prescribe to him his argument. And surely after Garnier had shown the
more excellent way of treating the subject so as to include both the
lovers, this truncated section of the history would not spontaneously
occur to any dramatist as the material most proper for his needs. It
seems more than likely that Daniel was acquainted with Jodelle’s play,
and that the precedent it furnished, determined him in his not very
happy selection of the final episode to the exclusion of all that went
before. A careful comparison of the two <i>Cleopatras</i> supports this
view. No doubt in general treatment they differ widely, and most of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
coincidences in detail are due to both authors having exploited
Plutarch’s narrative. But this is not true of all. There are some
traits that are not to be accounted for by their common pedigree, but
by direct transmission from the one to the other. Thus, to mention
the most striking, in Jodelle Seleucus is made to express penitence
for exposing the Queen’s misstatement about her treasure. There is
no authority for this: yet in Daniel the new <i>motif</i> reappears.
Of course it is not merely repeated without modification. In Jodelle
it is to the chorus that the culprit unbosoms himself; in Daniel it
is to Rodon, the false governor who has betrayed Caesarion, and who
similarly and no less fictitiously is represented as full of remorse
for his more heinous treason. But imitators frequently try in this
fashion to vary or heighten the effect by duplicating the rôles they
borrow; and Daniel has done so in a second instance, when he happened
to get his suggestion from Garnier. In the <i>Marc Antoine</i>, as
we saw, there is the sententious but quite superfluous figure of the
philosopher Philostratus; Daniel retains him without giving him more
to do, but places by his side the figure of the equally sententious
and superfluous philosopher Arius. In Rodon we have just such another
example of gemination. It is safe to say that the contrite Seleucus
comes straight from the pages of Jodelle; and his presence, if there
were any doubt, serves to establish Daniel’s connection with the first
French Senecan in the vernacular.</p>

<p>But the Countess’s protégé differs from her not only in reverting to
an elder model: he distinctly improves on her practice by substituting
for her blank verse his own quatrains. The author of the <i>Defence of
Ryme</i> showed a right instinct in this. Blank verse is doubtless the
better dramatic measure, but these pseudo-Senecan pieces were lyric
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
rather than dramatic, and it was not the most suitable for them. The
justice of Daniel’s method is proved by its success. He not only
carried the experiment successfully through for himself, which might
have been a <i>tour de force</i> on the part of the “well-languaged”
poet, but he imposed his metre on successors who were less skilled in
managing it, like Sir William Alexander.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the <i>Cleopatra</i> of Daniel, a play that, compared
even with the contemporary classical dramas of France, belongs to a
bygone phase of the art; a play that is no play at all, but a series
of harangues interspersed with odds and ends of dialogue and the due
choric songs; but that nevertheless, because it fulfils its own ideal
so thoroughly, is admirable in its kind, and still has charms for the
lover of poetry.</p>

<p>The first act is occupied with a soliloquy of Cleopatra,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
in which she laments her past pleasure and glory, and proclaims her
purpose of death.</p>

children. The next scene presents the famous interview between Caesar
and Cleopatra, with the disclosures of Seleucus, to which are added
Dolabella’s avowal of his admiration, and Caesar’s decision to carry
his prisoner to Rome. In the fourth act Seleucus, who has betrayed the
confidence of his mistress, bewails his disloyalty, to Rodon, who has
delivered up Caesarion to death; but they depart to avoid Cleopatra,
whom Dolabella has informed of the victor’s intentions, and who enters,

<p>One more example of the influence of the French Senecans remains to
be mentioned, and though, as a translation, it is less important than
Daniel’s free reproduction, the name of the translator gives it a
special interest. The stately rhetoric of the <i>Cornélie</i> caught
the fancy of Thomas Kyd, who from the outset had found something
sympathetic in Garnier’s style, and, perhaps in revolt from the
sensationalism of his original work, he wrote an English version which
was published in 1594. When this was so, it need the less surprise us
that the Senecan form should still for years to come be cultivated
by writers who had seen the glories of the Elizabethan stage, above
all for what would seem the peculiarly appropriate themes of classic
history: that Alexander should employ it for his <i>Julius Caesar</i>
and the rest of his <i>Monarchic Tragedies</i> even after Shakespeare’s
<i>Julius Caesar</i> had appeared, and that Ben Jonson himself
should, as it were, cast a wistful, backward glance at it in his
<i>Catiline</i>, which he supplies, not only with a chorus, but with
a very Senecan exposition by Sylla’s ghost. If this style appealed to
the author of <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, it might well appeal to the
more fastidious connoisseurs in whom the spirit of the Renaissance was
strong. It was to them Kyd looked for patronage in his new departure,
and he dedicates his <i>Cornelia</i> to the Countess of Suffolk, aunt
of the more memorable lady who had translated the <i>Marc Antoine</i>.</p>

<p>In execution it hardly equals the companion piece: the language is
less flexible and graphic, and the whole effect more wearisome; which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
however, may be due in part to the inferior merit of the play Kyd had
to render, as well as to the haste with which the rendering was made.
But he aims at preserving the spirit of the French, and does preserve
it in no small degree. The various metres of the chorus are managed
with occasional dexterity; the rhyme that is mingled with the blank
verse of the declamation relieves the tedium of its somewhat monotonous
tramp, and adds point and effectiveness. A fair specimen of his average
procedure may be found in his version of the metaphorical passage in
Cassius’ speech, that, as has been pointed out, can be traced back to
Grévin and Muretus.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The stiff-neckt horses champe not on the bit</div>

<p class="no-indent">Kyd was certainly capable of emphasis, both in the
good and the bad sense, which stands him in good stead when he has to
reproduce the passages adapted from Lucan. These he generally presents
in something of their native pomp, and indeed throughout he shows a
praiseworthy effort to keep on the level of his author. The result is
a grave and decorous performance, which, if necessarily lacking in
distinctive colour, since the original had so little, is almost equally
free from modern incongruities. It can hardly be reckoned as such that
Scipio grasps his “cutlass,” or that in similar cases the equivalent
for a technical Latin term should have a homely sound. Perhaps the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
serious anachronism occurs when Cicero, talking of “this great town” of
Rome, exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither could the flaxen-haird high Dutch,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(A martiall people, madding after Armes),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor yet the fierce and fiery humord French....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once dare t’assault it.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Garnier is not responsible: he writes quite correctly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ny les blons Germains, peuple enragé de guerre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ny le Gaulois ardent.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, however, is a very innocent slip. It was different when another
scholar of the group to which Kyd belonged treated a Roman theme in a
more popular way.</p>

<p>But before turning to him it may be well to say a word concerning the
influence which these Senecan pieces are sometimes supposed to have had
on Shakespeare’s Roman plays that dealt with kindred themes.</p>

<p>And in the first place it may be taken as extremely probable that he
had read them. They were well known to the Elizabethan public, the
least famous of them, Kyd’s <i>Cornelia</i>, reaching a second edition
within a year of its first issue. They were executed by persons who
must have bulked large in Shakespeare’s field of vision. Apart from
her general social and literary reputation, the Countess of Pembroke
was mother of the two young noblemen to whom the first folio of
Shakespeare’s plays was afterwards dedicated on the ground that they
had “prosequutted both them and the author living with so much favour.”
Some of Daniel’s works Shakespeare certainly knew, for there are
convincing parallelisms between the <i>Complaint of Rosamond</i> on the
one hand, and the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> and <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
on the other; nor can there be much question about the indebtedness
of Shakespeare’s <i>Sonnets</i> to Daniel’s <i>Delia</i>. Again, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Kyd’s acting dramas Shakespeare was undoubtedly acquainted. He quotes
<i>The Spanish Tragedy</i> in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i>Much
Ado About Nothing</i>, <i>King Lear</i>; and the same play, as well
as <i>Solyman and Perseda</i>, if that be Kyd’s, in <i>King John</i>:
nor is it to be forgotten that many see Kyd’s hand and few would deny
Kyd’s influence in <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and that some attribute to
him the lost <i>Hamlet</i>. All these things considered, Shakespeare’s
ignorance of the English Senecans would be much more surprising
than his knowledge of them. Further, though his own method was so
dissimilar, he would be quite inclined to appreciate them, as may be
inferred from the approval he puts in Hamlet’s mouth of <i>Æneas’ tale
to Dido</i>, which reads like a heightened version of the narratives
that occur so plentifully in their pages. So there is nothing
antecedently absurd in the conjecture that they gave him hints when he
turned to their authorities on his own behalf.</p>

<p>Nevertheless satisfactory proof is lacking. The analogies with
Garnier’s <i>Marc Antoine</i> not accounted for by the obligation of
both dramatists to Plutarch are very vague, and oddly enough seem
vaguer in the translation than in the original. Of this there is a good
example in Antony’s words when he recalls to his shame how his victor</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the brave squares of war.</div>
    <div class="verse indent15">(<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> x. 39.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There is similarity of <i>motif</i>, and even the
suggestion of something more, in his outburst in Garnier:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Un homme effeminé de corps et de courage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui du mestier de Mars n’apprist oncque l’usage.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But only the <i>motif</i> is left in the Countess
of Pembroke’s rendering:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A man, a woman both in might and minde,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Marses schole who neuer lesson learn’d.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
The alleged parallels are thus most apparent when Shakespeare is
collated with the French, and of these the chief that do not come from
Plutarch have already been quoted in the description of the <i>Marc
Antoine</i>. They are neither numerous nor striking. Besides Antony’s
disparagement of his rival’s soldiership there are only three that in
any way call for remark. In Garnier, Cleopatra’s picture of her shade
wandering beneath the cypress trees of the Underworld may suggest, in
Shakespeare, her lover’s anticipation of Elysium, “where souls do couch
on flowers” (<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="smcap">iv.</span> xiv. 51); but
there is a great difference in the tone of the context. Her dying utterance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Que de mille baisers, et mille et mille encore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pour office dernier ma bouche vous honore:</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">is in the wording not unlike the dying utterance of Antony:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of many thousand kisses the poor last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I lay upon thy lips;</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">(<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xv. 20.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">but there is more contrast than agreement in the
ideas. Above all, Cleopatra’s horror at the thought of her children
being led in triumph through Rome and pointed at by the herd of
citizens is close akin to the feeling that inspires similar passages in
Shakespeare (<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="smcap">iv.</span> xv. 23,
<span class="allsmcap">v.</span> ii. 55, <span class="allsmcap">v.</span> ii. 207);
but even here the resemblance is a little deceptive, since in
Shakespeare she feels this horror for herself.</p>

<p>The correspondences between Shakespeare and Daniel are equally
confined to detail, but they are more definite and more significant.
It is Daniel who first represents Cleopatra as scorning to be made a
spectacle in Rome; and her resentment at Caesar’s supposing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That I should underneath my selfe be seene,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
might have expressed itself in Shakespeare’s phrase,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be noble to myself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 191.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Noteworthy, too, in the same passage, is her
reluctance to pass before the injured Octavia, for there is no mention
of this point in Plutarch, but Shakespeare touches on it twice.
Further, her very noticeable references to her waning charms, her
wrinkles, her declining years have their analogies in Shakespeare and
in Shakespeare alone; for Plutarch expressly says that she was “at the
age when a woman’s beawtie is at the prime.” The tenderness in tone of
her address to the asp is common and peculiar to both English poets;
and her adornment in preparation for death suggests to each of them,
but not to Plutarch, her magnificence when she met Antony on the
Cydnus.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>These coincidences are interesting, but they are not conclusive. They
are none of them such as could not occur independently to two writers
who vividly realised the meaning of Plutarch’s <i>data</i>; for he, as
it were, gives the premises though he does not draw the inference. Thus
he says nothing of Cleopatra’s disdain for the Roman populace, but he
does make the knowledge that she must go to Rome determine her to die.
He says nothing of her recoil from the thought of Octavia seeing her
in her humiliation, but he does tell us of her jealousy of Octavia’s
superior claims. He never hints that Cleopatra was past her bloom, but
his praise of her as at her prime belongs to 41 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
and the closing incident to 30 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when she was in
her thirty-ninth year. He does not attribute to her any kindly greeting of the
asp, but he does report that she chose it as providing the easiest and gentlest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
means of death. And though in describing her suicide he makes no
reference to the meeting on the Cydnus, he dwells on the glorious array
on both occasions, and the fancy naturally flies from one to the other.
Each of these particulars separately might well suggest itself to more
than one sympathetic reader. The most that can be said is that in their
mass they have a certain cogency. In any case, however, characteristic
and far-reaching as some of them are, they bear only on details of the
conception.</p>

<p>The possible connection of <i>Julius Caesar</i> with the
<i>Cornélie</i> is of a somewhat different kind. It is restricted
almost entirely to the conversations between Cassius and Decimus Brutus
on the one hand, and between Cassius and Marcus Brutus on the other.
It is thought to show itself partly in particular expressions, partly
in the general situation. So far as the former are concerned, it is
neither precise nor distinctive; and it is rather remarkable that, as
in the case of the <i>Marc Antoine</i>, more is to be said for it when
Shakespeare’s phraseology is compared with that of the original than
when it is compared with that of the translation.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
In regard to the latter M. Bernage, the chief advocate of the theory,
writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">In the English play (<i>Julius Caesar</i>), as
in our own, Brutus and Cassius have an interview before the arrival
of the Dictator; the subject of their conversation is the same; it
is Cassius too who “strikes so much show of fire” (<i>fait jaillir
l’etincelle</i>) from the soul of Brutus.... These characters are
painted by Garnier in colours quite similar (to Shakespeare’s), and he
is momentarily as vigorous and great. In like manner ... Caesar crosses
the stage after the interview of the two conspirators; he is moreover
accompanied by Antony.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
In the whole tone and direction of the dialogue, too, Shakespeare
resembles Garnier and does not resemble Plutarch. The <i>Life</i>
records one short sentence as Brutus’ part of the colloquy, while
Cassius does nothing more than explain the importance of the anonymous
letters and set forth the expectations that Rome has formed of his
friend. There is no denunciation in Plutarch of Caesar either for his
overgrown power or for his “feeble temper”; there is no lament for the
degeneracy of the Romans; there is no reference to the expulsion of the
kings or appeal to Brutus’ ancestry; all of these matters on which both
the dramatists insist. And at the end the two friends are agreed on
their policy and depart to prosecute their plans, while in Garnier as
in Shakespeare Brutus comes to no final decision.</p>

<p>It would be curious if this conjecture were correct, and if this famous
scene had influenced Shakespeare as it was to influence Alexander.
There would be few more interesting cases of literary filiation, for,
as we have seen, there is no doubt that here Garnier bases and improves
on Grévin, and that Grévin bases and improves on Muretus; so the
genealogy would run Muretus, Grévin, Garnier, Kyd, Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Here the matter may rest. The grounds for believing that Shakespeare
was influenced by Garnier’s <i>Marc Antoine</i> are very slight; for
believing that he was influenced by Daniel’s <i>Cleopatra</i> are
somewhat stronger; that he was influenced by Garnier’s <i>Cornélie</i>
are stronger still; but they are even at the best precarious. In all
three instances the evidence brought forward rather suggests the
obligation as possible than establishes it as certain. But it seems
extremely likely that Shakespeare would be acquainted with dramas that
were widely read and were written by persons none of whom can have been
strange to him; and in that case their stateliness and propriety may
have affected him in other ways than we can trace or than he himself knew.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the popular play had been going its own way, and among other
subjects had selected a few from Roman history. We may be certain
that slowly and surely it was absorbing some of the qualities that
characterised the imitations of the classics; and this process was
accelerated when university men, with Marlowe at their head, took a
leading share in purveying for the London playhouse. The development
is clearly marked in the general history of the drama. Of the Roman
play in this transition phase, as treated by a scholar for the
delectation of the vulgar, we have only one specimen, but it is a
specimen that despite its scanty merit is important no less for the
name of the author than for the mode of the treatment. That author
was Thomas Lodge, so well known for his songs, novels, pamphlets, and
translations. As dramatist he is less conspicuous, and we possess
only two plays from his hand. In one of them, <i>A Looking Glass for
London and England</i>, which gives a description of the corruption
and repentance of Nineveh, and was acted in 1591, he co-operated with
Robert Greene. Of the other,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
<i>The Wounds of Civill War: Lively set forth in the true Tragedies of
Marius and Scilla: As it hath beene publicquely plaide in London, by
the Right Honourable the Lord High Admirall his Servants</i>, he was
sole author, and it is with it that we are concerned. It was printed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
1594, but was probably composed some years earlier.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
In any case it comes after the decisive appearance of Marlowe; but
Lodge was far from rivalling that master or profiting fully by his
example, and indeed is inferior to such minor performers as Peele or
Greene. Moreover, in the present case he adds to his general dramatic
disabilities, the incapacity to treat classical history aright. In this
respect, indeed, he improves on the Senecan school by borrowing graphic
minutiae from Plutarch, such as the prefiguration of Marius’ future
glory in his infancy by the seven eagles, the account of the Gaul’s
panic in Minturnae, or the unwilling betrayal of Antonius by the slave.
But on the other hand he astonishes us by his failure to make use of
picturesque incidents which he must have known; like Sulla’s flight for
shelter to his rival’s house, the relief of Marius by the woman whom he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
had sentenced, the response of the exile from the ruins of Carthage.
And even when he utilises Plutarch’s touches, Lodge is apt to weaken
or travesty them in his adaptation. The incident of the eagles, though
it furnishes two of the best passages in the play, illustrates the
enfeeblement. Plutarch had said:</p>

<p class="blockquot">When Marius was but very young and dwelling in the
contry, he gathered up in the lappe of his gowne the ayrie of an Eagle,
in the which were seven young Eagles; whereat his father and mother
much wondering, asked the Sooth-sayers, what that ment? They answered,
that their sonne one day should be one of the greatest men in the
world, and that out of doubt he should obtain seven times in his life
the chiefest office of dignity in his contry.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Plutarch is not quite sure about the
trustworthiness of this story, for the characteristic reason that “the
eagle never getteth but two younge ones,” and his hesitation may have
led Lodge to modify the vivid and improbable detail. Favorinus the
Minturnian tells the story thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">Yonder Marius in his infancy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was born to greater fortunes than we deem:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, being scarce from out his cradle crept,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sporting prettily with his compeers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On sudden seven young eagles soar’d amain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And kindly perch’d upon his tender lap.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His parents wondering at this strange event,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took counsel of the soothsayers in this:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who told them that these seven-fold eagles’ flight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forefigurèd his seven times consulship.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And this version, with only another slight
variation, is repeated rather happily in the invented narrative of the
presage of Marius’ death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bright was the day, and on the spreading trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The frolic citizens of forest sung</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">When suddenly appeared in the east</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seven mighty eagles with their talons fierce,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, waving oft above our consul’s head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At last with hideous cry did soar away:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When suddenly old Marius aghast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With reverend smile, determin’d with a sigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The doubtful silence of the standers-by.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Romans,” he said, “old Marius must die:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These seven fair eagles, birds of mighty Jove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That at my birthday on my cradle sat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now at my last day warn me to my death.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
But the other two passages Lodge modernises beyond recognition and
beyond decency.</p>

<p>Of the attempt on Marius’ life at Minturnae, Plutarch narrates very
impressively:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now when they were agreed upon it, they could not
finde a man in the citie that durst take upon him to kill him; but a
man of armes of the Gaules, or one of the Cimbres (for we finde both
the one or the other in wryting) that went thither with his sword
drawen in his hande. Now that place of the chamber where Marius lay was
very darke, and, as it is reported, the man of armes thought he sawe
two burninge flames come out of Marius eyen, and heard a voyce out of
that darke corner, saying unto him: “O, fellowe, thou, darest thou come
to kill Caius Marius?” The barbarous Gaule, hearing these words, ranne
out of the chamber presently, castinge his sworde in the middest of the
flower,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and crying out these wordes onely: “I can not kill Caius Marius.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">Here is Lodge’s burlesque with the Gaul nominated
Pedro, whose name is as unsuitable to his language as is his language
to his supposed nationality.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Pedro.</i> Marius tu es mort. Speak dy preres in dy sleepe, for

Things are scarcely better in the episode of Antonius’ betrayal.
Plutarch has told very simply how the poor man with whom the orator
took refuge, wishing to treat him hospitably, sent a slave for wine,
and how the slave, by requiring the best quality for the distinguished
guest, provoked the questions of the drawer. In Lodge the unsuspecting
serving man becomes a bibulous clown who blabs the secret in a drunken
catch that he sings as he passes the soldiers:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Lodge is not more fortunate with his additions.
Thus, after Sylla’s final resignation, two burghers with the very Roman

<p>Even more impertinent, because they violate the truth of character and
misrepresent an historical person, are some of the liberties Lodge
takes with Marius. Such is the device with the echo, which he transfers
from the love scenes of poetical Arcady, where it is quite appropriate,
to the mountains of Numidia, where it would hardly be in place even if
we disregarded the temperament and circumstances of the exile.</p>

Yet Lodge was a competent scholar who was by and by to translate
<i>The Famous and Memourable Workes of Josephus, a Man of Much Honour
and Learning among the Jewes</i>, and the <i>Works both Moral and
Natural of Lucius Annaeus Seneca</i>. And already in this play he
makes Sylla’s genius, invisible to all, summon him in Latin Elegiacs
audible only to him. If then the popular scenes in Shakespeare’s Roman
plays do not make a very Roman impression, it should be remembered
that he is punctilious in comparison with the University gentleman who
preceded him. Nor did the fashion of popularising antique themes with
vulgar frippery from the present die out when Shakespeare showed a
more excellent way. There is something of very much the same kind in
Heywood’s <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> which was published in 1608.</p>

<p>But these superficial laches are not the most objectionable things in
the play. There is nothing organic in it. Of course its neglect of the
unities of time and place is natural and right, but it is careless
of unity in structure or even in portraiture. The canvas is crowded
with subordinate figures who perplex the action without producing a
vivid impression of their own characters. A few are made distinct by
insistence on particular traits, like Octavius with his unbending civic
virtue, or Antonius with his ‘honey-dropping’ and rather ineffectual
eloquence, or Lepidus with his braggard temporising. The only one
of them who has real individuality is the younger Marius, insolent,
fierce, and cruel, but full of energy and filial affection, and too
proud to survive his fortunes. He perhaps is the most consistent and
sympathetic person in the piece; which of itself is a criticism, for he
occupies a much less important place than the two principals, expressly
announced as the heroes in the title-page. It is difficult even to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
guess the intention of the author in this delineation of them, and in
any case the result is not pleasing. Marius, despite a certain amount
of tough fortitude—which for the rest is not so indomitable as in
Plutarch—and a rude magnanimity displayed in the imaginary scene with
Sylla’s daughter and wife, is far from attractive; and it comes as
a surprise that after all his violence and vindictiveness he should
meet his death “with a reverend smile” in placid resignation. But with
Sylla matters are worse. He would be altogether repulsive but for
his courage, and Lodge seems to explain him and his career only by
appealing to his own adopted epithet of Felix or Fortunate. His last
words are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Fortune, now I bless thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That both in life and death would’st not oppress me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And when, “to conclude his happiness,” his sumptuous funeral
is arranged, Pompey expresses the same idea in the lines that close the play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, bear we hence this trophy of renown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose life, whose death was far from Fortune’s frown.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The problem of his strange story is not so much stated as implied,
and far less is there any attempt at a solution. After all his
blood-guiltiness, he too, like Marius, passes away in peace, but with
him the peacefulness rises to the serenity of a saint or sage. To his
friend he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My Flaccus, worldly joys and pleasures fade;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inconstant time, like to the fleeting tide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With endless course man’s hopes doth overbear:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now nought remains that Sylla fain would have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But lasting fame when body lies in grave.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">To his wife, who soon after asks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How fares my lord? How doth my gentle Sylla?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">he replies still more devoutly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Free from the world, allied unto the heavens;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not curious of incertain chances now.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
There is thus no meaning in the story. The rival leaders are equally
responsible for the Wounds of Civil War, but end as happily as though
they had been benefactors of society. And this is by no means presented
as an example of tragic irony, in which case something might be said
for it, but as the natural, fitting, and satisfactory conclusion. Yet
Plutarch tells of Marius’ sleeplessness, drunkenness, and perturbation,
and of Sylla‘s debaucheries and disease. These were hints, one might
have thought, that would have suited the temper of an Elizabethan
dramatist; but Lodge passes them over.</p>

<p>It is the same with the public story. If Rome is left in quiet it is
only because Sylla’s ruthlessness has been ‘fortunate’; it is not
represented as the rational outcome of what went before, nor is there
any suggestion of what was to follow after.</p>

<p>The merit of the play, such as it is, lies in its succession of
stirring scenes—but not the most stirring that might have been
selected—from the career of two famous personalities in the history of
a famous State. It is almost incredible that in barely more than half
a dozen years after its publication London playgoers were listening
to <i>Julius Caesar</i> with its suggestive episodes, its noble
characterisation, and full realisation of what the story meant.</p>

<p>Yet Lodge’s play is probably as good as any of those based on Roman
History till Shakespeare turned his attention to such subjects. The
titles of a number of others have come down to us. Some of these are
of early date and may have approximated to the type of <i>Apius and
Virginia</i>. Others would attempt the style of Seneca, either after
the crude fashion of <i>Gorboduc</i> or subsequently under the better
guidance of the French practitioners; and among these later Senecans
were distinguished men like Lord Brooke, who destroyed a tragedy on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in 1601, and Brandon, whose <i>Vertuous
Octavia</i>, written in 1598, still survives.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
In others again there may have been an anticipation or imitation of
the more popular manner of Lodge. But the fact that they were never
published, or have been lost, or, in one or two cases where isolated
copies are extant, have not been thought worth reprinting, affords a
presumption that their claims are inferior, and that in them no very
characteristic note is struck. It is pretty safe to suppose that they
did not contain much instruction for Shakespeare, and that none of
them would bridge the gap between Lodge’s medley and Shakespeare’s
masterpiece.</p>

<p>The progress made since the middle of the century was, of course,
considerable. A pioneer performance, like <i>Apius and Virginia</i>,
had the merit of pushing beyond the landmarks of the old Morality,
and of bringing Roman story within the ken of English playgoers,
but it did nothing more. It treated this precisely as it might have
treated any other subject, and looked merely to the lesson, though,
no doubt, it sought to make the lesson palatable with such dramatic
condiments as the art of the day supplied. The Senecans, inspired by
the <i>Octavia</i>, make a disinterested effort to detach and set
forth the conception of old Roman greatness, as it was given that age
to understand it, and these productions show no impropriety and much
literary skill, but the outlines and colours are too vague to admit of
reality or life. Lodge is realistic enough in his way, but it is by
sacrificing what is significant and characteristic, and submerging the
majesty of ancient Rome in the banalities and trivialities of his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
time. No dramatist had been able at once to rise to the grandeur of
the theme and keep a foothold on solid earth, to reconcile the claims
of the ideal and the real, the past and the present. That was left for
Shakespeare to do.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SHAKESPEARE’S TREATMENT OF HISTORY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The turn of the centuries roughly bisects the dramatic career of
Shakespeare. In the first half he had written many comedies and a few
tragedies; in the second he was to write many tragedies with a few
plays which, on account of the happy ending and other traits, may
be assigned to the opposite class. But beyond these recognised and
legitimate subdivisions of the Romantic Drama, he had also before 1600
busied himself with that characteristic product of the Elizabethan
Age, the Historical Play dealing with the national annals. In this
kind, indeed, he had been hardly less abundant than in comedy, the
proportions being nine of the one to eleven of the other. Then suddenly
he leaves it aside, and returns to it only at the close in <i>Henry
VIII.</i>, which moreover is but partially his handiwork.</p>

<p>Thus, while the tragic note is not inaudible in the earlier period of
his activity nor the comic note in the later, the third, that sounded
so loud in the sixteenth century, utterly or all but utterly dies away
in the seventeenth.</p>

<p>Why this should be so it is impossible to say. It may be that the
patriotic self-consciousness stirred by the defeat of the Armada and
the triumph of England waned with the growing sense of internal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
grievances and the loss of external prestige, and that the national
story no longer inspired such curiosity and delight. It may be that
Shakespeare had exhausted the episodes which had a special attraction
for contemporaries and himself. It may be that he found in the records
of other lands themes that gave his genius freer scope and more fully
satisfied the requirements of his art. Or all these considerations may
have co-operated.</p>

<p>For the last of them there is at any rate this much to say, that,
though the play on native history virtually disappears, the Historical
Play as such survives and wins new triumphs. The Roman group resembles
the English group in many ways, and, where they differ, it has
excellences of its own.</p>

<p>What are the main points in which respectively they diverge
or coincide?</p>

<p>(1) There is no doubt that it was patriotic enthusiasm that called into
existence the Chronicle Histories so numerous in Elizabeth’s reign, of
which the best in Shakespeare’s series are only the consummate flower.
The pride in the present and confidence in the future of England found
vent, too, in occupation with England’s past, and since the general
appetite could not be satisfied by the histories of every sort and
size that issued from the press, the vigorous young drama seized the
opportunity of extending its operations, and stepped in to supply the
demand. Probably with a more definite theory of its aims, methods,
and sphere there might have been less readiness to undertake the new
department. But in the popular conception the play was little else
than a narrative presented in scenes. The only requirement was that
it should interest the spectators, and few troubled themselves about
classic rule and precedent, or even about connected structure and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
arrangement. And when by and by the Elizabethan Tragedy and Comedy
became more organic and vertebrate, the Historic Play had secured
recognition, and was able to persist in what was dramatically a
more rudimentary phase and develop without regard to more exacting
standards. Shakespeare’s later Histories, precisely the superlative
specimens of the whole species, illustrate this with conspicuous force.
The subject of <i>Henry IV.</i>, if presented in summary, must seem
comparatively commonplace; the ‘argument’ of both parts, if analysed,
is loose and straggling; the second part to a great extent repeats
at a lower pitch the <i>motifs</i> of the first; yet it is hardly
if at all less excellent than its predecessor, and together they
represent Shakespeare’s grand achievement in this kind. In <i>Henry
V.</i>, which has merits that make it at least one of the most popular
pieces that Shakespeare ever wrote, the distinctively narrative wins
the day against the distinctively dramatic. Not only are some of the
essential links supplied only in the story of the chorus, but there
is no dramatic collision of ideas, no conflict in the soul of the
hero, except in the scenes preliminary to Agincourt, not even much of
the excitement of suspense. It is a plain straightforward history,
admirably conveyed in scene and speech, all the episodes significant
and picturesque, all the persons vividly characterised, bound to stir
and inspire by its sane and healthy patriotism; but in the notes that
are considered to make up the <i>differentia</i> of a drama, whether
ancient or modern, it is undoubtedly defective.</p>

<p>In proportion then as Shakespeare realised the requirements of the
Chronicle History, and succeeded in producing his masterpieces in this
domain, he deviated from the course that he pursued in his other plays.
And this necessarily followed from the end he had in view. He wished to
give, and his audience wished to get, passages from the history of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
country set forth on the stage as pregnantly and attractively as
possible; but the history was the first and chief thing, and in it
the whole species had its <i>raison d’être</i>. History delivered the
material and prescribed the treatment, and even the selection of the
episodes treated was determined less perhaps by their natural fitness
for dramatic form, than by the influence of certain contemporary
historic interests. For the points which the average Elizabethan had
most at heart were—(1) The unity of the country under the strong
and orderly government of securely succeeding sovereigns, who should
preserve it from the long remembered evils of Civil War; (2) Its
rejection of Papal domination, with which there might be, but more
frequently among the play-going classes, there was not associated the
desire for a more radical reconstruction of the Church; (3) The power,
safety and prestige of England, which Englishmen believed to be the
inevitable consequence of her unity and independence. So whatever in
bygone times bore on these matters and could be made to illustrate
them, whether by parallel or contrast, was sure of a sympathetic
hearing. And in this as in other points Shakespeare seems to have
felt with his fellow-men and shared their presuppositions. At least
all the ten plays on English history in which he is known to have had
a hand deal with rivalry for the throne, the struggle with Rome, the
success or failure in France accordingly as the prescribed postulates
are fulfilled or violated. It may have been his engrossment in these
concerns that sometimes led him to choose subjects which the mere
artist would have rejected as of small dramatic promise.</p>

<p>When he turned to the records of antiquity, the conditions were very
different. Doubtless to a man of the Renaissance classical history in
its appeal came only second, if even second, to the history of his own
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
land; doubtless also to the man who was not a technical scholar, the
history of Rome had far more familiar charm than the history of Greece.
When, therefore, Shakespeare went outside his own England in search
for historical themes, he was still addressing the general heart, and
showed himself in closer accord with popular taste than, <i>e.g.</i>
Chapman, whose French plays are perhaps next to his own among the best
Elizabethan examples of the historical drama. But we may be sure that
Ambois and Biron and Chabot were much less interesting persons to the
ordinary Londoner than Caesar and Antony and Coriolanus. Not merely
in treatment, but in selection of the material—which cannot fail to
influence the treatment—Shakespeare was in touch with common feeling
and popular taste.</p>

<p>All the same a great deal more was now required than in the case of
the English series. In that the story of a reign or the section of
a reign, the chronicle of a flimsy conspiracy or a foreign campaign
might furnish the framework for a production that would delight the
audience. It was otherwise when dramatist and spectators alike knew the
history only in its mass, and were impressed only by the outstanding
features. Just as with individuals so with nations, many things become
significant and important in those of our familiar circle that would
seem trivial in mere strangers and acquaintances. If the Roman plays
were to be popular as the English ones had been, Shakespeare was bound
to select episodes of more salient interest and more catholic appeal
than such as had hitherto sometimes served his turn. In the best of
the English plays we constantly wonder that Shakespeare could get such
results from stories that we should have thought in advance to be quite
unfit for the stage. But the fall of Caesar and the fate of those who
sought to strangle the infant empire, the shock of opposing forces in
Augustus and Antony and the loss of the world for Cleopatra’s love, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
triumph and destruction of the glorious renegade from whose wrath the
young republic escaped as by fire—that there are tragic possibilities
in themes like these is patent to a casual glance. It is significant
that, while of the subjects handled in the English histories only the
episode of Joan of Arc and the story of Richard III. have attracted
the attention of foreign dramatists, all the Roman plays have European
congeners. One of the reasons may be, that though the events described
in the national series are dramatic enough for national purposes, they
do not like the others satisfy the severer international test.</p>

<p>And to a difference in the character of the material corresponds a
difference in the character of the treatment. The best of the English
plays, as we have seen, are precisely those that it would be hardest
to describe in terms of the ordinary drama. The juvenile <i>Richard
III.</i> is the only one that could nowadays without objection be
included in a list of Shakespeare’s tragedies. But with the Roman plays
it is quite the reverse. In the main lines of construction they are
of tragic build; there is invariably a tragic problem in the hero’s
career; and it reaches a tragic solution in his self-caused ruin. So
they are always ranked with the Tragedies, and though here and there
they may show a variation from Shakespeare’s usual tragic technique,
it would occur to no one to alter the arrangement.</p>

<p>(2) Yet these little variations may remind us that after all they
were not produced under quite the same presuppositions as plays
like <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Othello</i>, or even <i>King Lear</i> and
<i>Macbeth</i>. In a sense they remain <i>Histories</i>, as truly
histories as any of their English analogues. The political vicissitudes
and public catastrophes do not indeed contribute the chief elements of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
interest. Here as everywhere Shakespeare is above all occupied with the
career of individuals, with the interaction of persons and persons,
and of persons and circumstances. Nevertheless in these plays the
characters are always exhibited in relation to the great mutations in
the State. Not merely the background but the environment and atmosphere
are supplied by the large life of affairs. It is not so in <i>Lear</i>,
where the legend offered no tangible history on which the imagination
could take hold; it is only partially so in <i>Macbeth</i>, where
Shakespeare knew practically nothing of the actual local conditions;
nor, had it been otherwise, was there anything in these traditions of
prerogative importance for later times. But in the Roman plays the
main facts were accredited and known, and of infinite significance for
the history of the world. They could not be overlooked, they had to be
taken into account.</p>

<p>For the same reason they must no more be tampered with than the
accepted facts of English History. The two historical series are again
alike in this, that they treat their sources with much more reverence
than either the Comedies or the other Tragedies show for theirs.
Even in <i>Lear</i> the dramatist has no scruple about altering the
traditional close; even in <i>Macbeth</i> he has no scruple about
blending the stories of two reigns. But in dealing with the professedly
authentic records whether of England or Rome, Shakespeare felt that he
had to do with the actual, with what definitely had been; and he did
not conceive himself free to give invention the rein, as when with a
light heart he reshaped the caprices of a novel or the perversions of
a legend. As historical dramatist he was subordinated to his subject
much in the same way as the portrait painter. He could choose his point
of view, and manage the lights and shades, and determine the pose.
He could emphasize details, or slur them over, or even leave them out.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
He could interpret and reveal, so far as in him lay, the meaning and
spirit of history. But he had his marching orders and could no more
depart from them to take a more attractive way of his own, than the
portrait painter can correct the defects of his sitter to make him
an Apollo. It cannot always have been easy to keep true to this
self-denying ordinance. Despite the suitability of the subject in
general suggestion and even in many particular incidents there must
have been a recalcitrance to treatment here and there; and traces
of this may be detected, if the Roman plays are compared with the
tragedies in which the genius of Shakespeare had quite unimpeded sway.
To some of the chief of these traces Mr. Bradley has called attention.
Thus there is in the middle of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, owing to
the undramatic nature of the historic material, an excessive number
of brief scenes “in which the <i>dramatis personae</i> are frequently
changed, as though a novelist were to tell his story in a succession of
short chapters, in which he flitted from one group of his characters
to another.” In <i>Coriolanus</i>, “if Shakespeare had made the hero
persist and we had seen him amid the flaming ruins of Rome, awaking
suddenly to the enormity of his deed and taking vengeance on himself
... that would merely have been an ending more strictly tragic<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
than the close of Shakespeare’s play.” In <i>Julius Caesar</i> the “famous
and wonderful” quarrel scene between Brutus and Cassius is “an episode
the removal of which would not affect the actual sequence of events
(unless we may hold that but for the emotion caused by the quarrel and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
reconciliation Cassius would not have allowed Brutus to overcome his
objection to the fatal policy of offering battle at Philippi).” Mr.
Bradley discusses this in another connection, and here, as we shall
see, Shakespeare only partially adheres to his authority. In the same
play, however, we have the episode of the poet Cinna’s murder which,
however useful in illustrating the temper of the mob and suggestive
in other respects, is nevertheless a somewhat crude intrusion of
history, for it leads to nothing and in no way helps on the action. But
Shakespeare will put up with an occasional awkwardness in the mechanism
rather than fail to give what he considers a faithful picture. As in
the best English Histories he omits, he compresses, he even regroups;
but he never consciously alters the sense, and to bring out the sense
he utilises material that puts a little strain on his art.</p>

<p>Yet of course this does not mean that in the Roman any more than
in the English plays he attempts an accurate reconstruction of the
past. It may even be doubted whether such an attempt would have been
intelligible to him or to any save one or two of his contemporaries.
To the average Elizabethan (and in this respect Shakespeare was an
average Elizabethan, with infinitely clearer vision certainly, but
with the same outlook and horizon) the past differed from the present
chiefly by its distance and dimness; and distinctive contrasts in
manners and customs were but scantily recognised. A generation later
French audiences could view the perruques and patches of Corneille’s
Romans without any sense of incongruity, and the assimilation of the
ancient to the modern was in some respects much more thorough-going
in Shakespeare’s England. In all his classical pieces the impression
of historic actuality and the genuine antique <i>cachet</i> is only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
produced when there is a kind of inner kinship between the
circumstances to be represented and the English life that he knew.
There was a good deal of such correspondence between Elizabethan life
and Roman life, so the Roman Tragedies have a breath of historic
verisimilitude and even a faint suggestion of local colour. There was
much less between Elizabethan life and Greek life, so <i>Timon</i>
and <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, though true as human documents, have
almost nothing Hellenic about them. But even in the Roman plays, so
soon as there is anything that involves a distinctive difference
between Rome and London Shakespeare is sure to miss it. Anachronisms
in detail are of course abundantly unimportant, though a formidable
list of them could be computed. In <i>Julius Caesar</i> there are
clocks that strike, and the crowd throw up their sweaty nightcaps. The
arrangements of the Elizabethan stage furnish Cleopatra and Comminius
with similes. Menenius is familiar with funeral knells and batteries
and Galen’s prescriptions.</p>

<p>These are <i>minutiae</i> on which students like Bacon or Ben Jonson
might set store, but in regard to which Shakespeare was quite
untroubled and careless. Perhaps they deserve notice only because they
add one little item to the mass of proof that the plays were written
by a man of merely ordinary information, not by a trained scholar.
But for themselves they may be disregarded. It is not such trifles
that interfere with fidelity to antiquity. But in weightier matters,
too, Shakespeare shows an inevitable limitation in reproducing a
civilisation that was in some aspects very different from his own,
and for which he had no parallel in his own experience. He shows a
precisely analogous limitation when he deals with themes from English
History that were partly alien to the spirit of the time. Of this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
<i>King John</i> furnishes the grand example. We all know why that
troublesome reign is memorable now, not merely to the constitutional
historian, but to the man in the street and the child on the school
bench. Yet Shakespeare makes no mention of Runnymede or the Great
Charter; and we may assume that he, like most Elizabethans, if
interested in such matters at all, would have been unsympathetic
to a movement that extorted liberties by civil strife. To him the
significant points are the disputed succession, the struggle with
the Pope, the initial invasion of France by England when the Kingdom
is of one accord, and the subsequent invasion of England by France,
when it is divided against itself. So <i>King John</i>, though very
true to human nature and even to certain aspects of the period, pays
no heed to the aspect which other generations have considered the
most important of all, and one which on any estimate is not to be
overlooked. But if Shakespeare thus misses a conspicuous feature in a
set of occurrences that took place among his own people less than four
hundred years before, we need not wonder if he failed to detect the
peculiar features of ancient Rome as it existed at a further distance
of twelve or sixteen centuries. His approximation to the actual or
alleged conditions varies indeed in the different plays. It is closest
in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>. In that there is hardly a personage or
circumstance for which he had not some sort of a clue. He knew about
soldiers of fortune like Enobarbus and pirate-adventurers like Menas; a
ruler like Henry VII. had in him a touch of Octavius, there were not a
few notabilities in Europe who carried a suggestion of Mark Antony, the
orgies of Cleopatra’s court in Egypt were analogous to those of many
an Italian or French court at the Renaissance. It is all native ground
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to Shakespeare and he would feel himself at home. On the other hand,
he is least capable of seeing eye to eye the primitive republican life
which on Plutarch’s evidence he has to depict in <i>Coriolanus</i>. The
shrewd, resolute, law-abiding Commons, whom some of the traditions that
Plutarch worked up seem meant to exalt; the plebs that might secede to
the Holy Mount, but would not rise in armed revolt; that secured the
tribunate as its constitutional lever with which it was by and by to
shift the political centre of gravity, this was like nothing that he
knew or that anybody else knew about till half a century had elapsed.
He could only represent it in terms of a contemporary city mob; and
the consequence is that though he has given a splendid picture that
satisfies the imagination and even realises some of Plutarch’s hints,
it is not true to the whole situation as envisaged by
Plutarch.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
<i>Julius Caesar</i> occupies a kind of intermediate position, and for
that reason illustrates his method most completely. He could understand
a good deal of the political crisis in Rome on which that story turns,
from the existing conditions or recent memories of his own country.
In both a period of civil turmoil had ended in the establishment of
a strong government. In both there were nobles who from principle
or interest were opposed to the change, so he could enter into the
feelings of the conspirators. In both the centralisation of authority
was the urgent need, so he could appreciate the indispensableness of
the Empire, the ‘spirit of Caesar.’ But of zeal for the republican
theory as such he knows nothing, and therefore his Brutus is only in
part the Brutus of Plutarch.</p>

<p>Thus Shakespeare in his picture of Rome and Romans, does not give the
notes that mark off Roman from every other civilisation, but rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
those that it possessed in common with the rest, and especially with
his own. He even puts into it, without any consciousness of the
discrepancy, qualities that are characteristic of Elizabethan rather
than of Roman life. And the whole result, the quickening of the antique
material with modern feeling in so far as that is also antique, and
occasionally when it is not quite antique, is due to the thorough
realisation of the subject in Shakespeare’s own mind from his own
point of view, with all the powers not only of his reason, but of his
imagination, emotion, passion, and experience. Hence his delineations
are in point of fact more truly antique than those of many much more
scholarly poets, who can reproduce the minute peculiarities, but not,
what is more central and essential, the living energy and principle of
it all. This was felt by contemporaries. We have the express testimony
of the erudite Leonard Digges, who after graduating as Bachelor in
Oxford, continued his studies for many years in several foreign
universities, and consequently was promoted on his return to the
honorary degree of Master, a man who, with his academic training and
academic status, would not be apt to undervalue literal accuracy. But
he writes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So have I seen when Caesar would appear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the stage at half-sword parley were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brutus and Cassius: oh! how the audience</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were ravish’d, with what wonder went they thence;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When some new day they would not brook a line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of tedious though well-labour’d <i>Catiline</i>,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sejanus too was irksome.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Ben Jonson in <i>Sejanus</i> and <i>Catiline</i>
tried to restore antiquity in its exclusive and exceptional traits.
Shakespeare approached it on its more catholic and human side,
interpreted it by those qualities in modern life that face towards
the classical ideal, and even went the length of using at unawares
some that were more <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
typical of his new world. And Jonson’s Roman plays were felt to be
well-laboured and irksome, while his filled the spectators with
ravishment and wonder.</p>

<p>In both series then, English and Roman alike, Shakespeare on the one
hand loyally accepted his authorities and never deviated from them on
their main route, but on the other he treated them unquestioningly
from his own point of view, and probably never even suspected that
their own might be different. This is the double characteristic of his
attitude to his documents, and it combines pious regard for the assumed
facts of History with complete indifference to critical research. He
is as far as possible from submitting to the dead hand of the past,
but he is also as far as possible from allowing himself a free hand
in its manipulation. His method, in short, implies and includes two
principles, which, if separated, may easily become antagonistic, and
which, in point of fact, have led later schools of the historic drama
in quite opposite directions. A short examination of these contrasted
tendencies may perhaps help to throw a clearer light on Shakespeare’s
own position.</p>

<p>The one that lays stress on the artist’s right to take counsel with
his own ideas has been explained by Lessing in a famous passage of the
<i>Hamburg Dramaturgy</i>, which is all the more interesting for the
present purpose, that throughout it tacitly or expressly appeals to
the practice of Shakespeare. Lessing starts with Aristotle’s doctrine
that poetry is more pregnant than history, and asks why, when this is
so, the poet does not keep within the kingdom of his imagination, why
more especially the dramatist descends to the lower artistic level
of the historian to trespass on the domain of prosaic fact. And he
answers that it is merely a matter of convenience. There is advantage
to be gained from illustrious position and impressive associations; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
moreover the playwright finds it helpful that the audience should
already have some idea of the story to be told, that they should, as
it were, meet him half way, and bring to the understanding of his
piece some general knowledge of the persons. He gains his purpose if
he employs famous names which appear in a nimbus of associations, and
saves time in describing their characters and circumstances; and thus
they attune our minds for what is to come and serve as so many labels
by means of which, when we see a new play, we may inform ourselves
what it is all about. The initial familiarity and the prestige it
implies are fulcra for moving the interest of the beholders. The
historical dramatist, therefore, must be careful not to alter the
current conceptions of character; but, with that proviso, he has almost
unlimited powers, and may omit or recast or invent incidents, or forge
an entirely new story, just as he pleases, so long, that is, as he
leaves the character intact and does not interfere with our idea of the
hero. In that case the historic label would be more of a hindrance than
a help to our enjoyment.</p>

<p>Lessing’s view of the Historic Drama (and there is no doubt that he
thought he was describing the method of Shakespeare) is therefore
that it is a free work of fiction woven around characters that are
fairly well known. He was certainly wrong about Shakespeare, and his
theory strikes us nowadays as strangely inadequate, but it had very
important results. It directly influenced the dramatic art of Germany,
and it would be hard to overestimate the share it had in determining
Schiller’s methods of composition. It was in the air at the time of the
Romantic Movement in France, and is really the principle on which Hugo
constructs his more important plays in this kind. Schiller’s treatment
of history is very free; he invents scenes that have no shadow of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
foundation in fact, and yet are of crucial importance in his idealised
narrative; he invents subordinate persons who are hardly less
conspicuous than the authentic principals, and who vitally affect the
plot and action. All his plays contain these licenses. Such episodes as
the interview between Mary and Elizabeth, of Jeanne Darc’s indulgence
of her pity illustrate the first, such figures as Mortimer or Max and
Thekla illustrate the second; but what would <i>Mary Stuart</i> or
the <i>Maid of Orleans</i> or <i>Wallenstein</i> be without them? And
with Victor Hugo this emancipation from authority is pushed to even
greater lengths. Plays like <i>Le Roi s’amuse</i> or <i>Marion de
Lorme</i> might recall the vagaries of early Elizabethan experiments
like Greene’s <i>James IV.</i>, were it not that they are works of
incomparably higher genius. Hugo has accepted the traditional view of
a French king and a French court, but all the rest is sheer romance on
which just here and there we detect the trail of an old <i>mémoire</i>.</p>

<p>Now, some of the extreme examples suggest a two-fold objection to
Lessing’s account as a quite satisfactory explanation of the species.</p>

<p>In the first place, when the poet carries his privilege of independence
so far, why should he not go a step further and invent his entire
drama, names and all? As it is, we either know something of the real
history or we do not. If we do not, what is the advantage of appealing
to it? If we do, will not such lordly disregard of facts stir up the
same recalcitrance as disregard of traditional character, and shall
we not be rather perplexed than aided by the conflict between our
reminiscences and the statements of the play?</p>

<p>And, in the second place, is the portrayer of human nature to take his
historical persons as once for all given and fixed, so that he must
leave the accepted estimate of them intact without attempting to modify
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
it? Surely that would be to deprive the dramatist of his greater
privilege and the drama of its greatest opportunity. For then we
should only see a well-known character illustrated or described
anew, displaying its various traits in this or that set of novel
surroundings. But there would be little room for the sort of work that
the historic drama is specially fitted to do, viz. the exposition
of ambiguous or problematic natures, which will give us a different
conception of them from the one we have hitherto had.</p>

<p>Hence there arose in Germany a view directly opposed to that of
Lessing, and Lotze does not hesitate to recommend the most painstaking
investigation and observance of the real facts. The poet, he thinks,
will find scope enough in giving a new interpretation of the career
and individuality of the hero, after he has used all the means in his
power to bring home to his imagination the actual circumstances from
which they emerged. Probably little was known in England of this theory
of Lotze’s, though utterances to the same effect occur in Carlyle,
especially in his remarks on Shakespeare’s English Histories; yet
it seems to give a correct account of the way in which most English
historical dramas were constructed in the nineteenth century. Sir Henry
Taylor, while calling <i>Philip van Artevelde</i> “a dramatic romance,”
is careful to state that “historic truth is preserved in it, as far as
the material events are concerned.” Mr. Swinburne, in his trilogy on
Mary Stuart, versifies whole pages of contemporary writers (<i>e.g.</i>
in the interview of Mary and Knox taken almost verbatim from Knox’s
<i>History of the Reformation</i>), and in his prose essay seems
specially to value himself on his exact delineation of her career, and
his solution of the problem of her strange nature. But the prerogative
instance is furnished by Tennyson. In his dedication of <i>Harold</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
he writes to Lord Lytton: “After old-world records like the Bayeux
Tapestry and the Roman de Rou, Edward Freeman’s <i>History of the
Norman Conquest</i> and your father’s historical romance treating of
the same theme have been mainly helpful to me in writing this drama.”
He puts his antiquarian researches first, his use of the best modern
critical authorities second, and only in the third place an historical
romance, to which for the rest Freeman has said that he owes something
himself. Nor would it be difficult to show that in <i>Queen Mary</i>
and <i>Becket</i> he has followed the same lines. And on such lines it
is clear that the historical dramatist’s only aim must be to present
in accurate though artistic form a selection of the incidents and
circumstances of the hero’s life and times, and place them in such
mutual relation that they throw new light on the nature and destiny of
the man.</p>

<p>But from this point of view the functions of the poet and the historian
will tend to coalesce, and it is just this that at first sight rouses
suspicion. After all can we so reproduce the past as to give it real
immediate truth? It is hardly possible by antiquarian knowledge
quickened by ever so much poetic power to galvanise into life a state
of things that once for all is dead and gone. And meanwhile the mere
effort to do so is apt to make the drama a little frigid, as Tennyson’s
dramas are. We are seldom carried away on a spontaneous stream of
passion; for after all the methods of the historian and the poet are
radically different, and the painful mosaic work of the one is almost
directly opposed to the complete vision, the creation in one jet, which
may be rightly expected of the other.</p>

<p>But it is noteworthy that though the two schools which we have just
discussed, make appeal to Shakespeare, his own procedure does not
precisely agree with that of one or other. He is too much of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
heaven-born poet for the latter; he has too genuine a delight in facts
for the former. He has points of contact with both, but in a way he is
more <i>naïf</i> and simple-minded than either. He at the same time
accepts the current conception of character with Lessing, and respects
the allegations of history with Carlyle. But though he begins with the
ordinary impression produced by his hero, he does not stop there. Such
an impression is bound to be incoherent and vague. Shakespeare probes
and defines it; he tests it in relation to the assumed facts on which
it is based; he discovers the latent difficulties, faces them, and
solves them, and, starting with a conventional type, leaves us with an
individual man. In doing this he treats the facts as a means, not as an
end, but he does not sophisticate them. We hardly ever find fictitious
persons and scenes in Schiller’s style, and when we do the exception
proves the rule, for they have not the same function as in Schiller’s
theatre. Falstaff plays his part aside, as it were, from the official
history, he belongs to the private life of Prince Hal, and is impotent
to affect the march of public events. People like Lucius in <i>Julius
Caesar</i>, or Nicanor in <i>Coriolanus</i>, or Silius in <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> do not interfere in the political story; they are
present to make or to hear comments, or at most to assist the inward
interpretation. No unhistorical person has historical work to do, and
no unhistorical episode affects the historical action.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Yet he quite escapes from the chill and closeness of the book-room. He engages
in no critical investigations to sift out the genuine facts. He does not
study old tapestry or early texts. Unhampered by the learned apparatus
of the scholar, undistracted by the need of pausing to verify or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
correct, he speeds along on the flood-tide of his own inspiration,
which takes the same course with the interests of the nation. For it is
the reward of the intimate sympathy which exists between him and his
countrymen, that he goes to work, his personal genius fortified and
enlarged by the popular enthusiasms, patriotic or cosmopolitan. And
nothing can withstand the speed and volume of the current. There is a
great contrast between the broad free sweep of his Histories, English
or Roman, that lift us from our feet and carry us away, and the little
artificial channels of the antiquarian dramas, on the margin of which
we stand at ease to criticise the purity of the distilled water. Yet
none the less he is in a sense more obedient to his authorities than
any writer of the antiquarian school. Just because, while desiring to
give the truth as he knows it, he is careless to examine the accuracy
or estimate the value of the documents he consults; and just because,
while determined to give a faithful narrative, he spares himself all
labour of comparison and research and takes a statement of Holinshed
or Plutarch as guaranteeing itself, he is far more in the hands of
the guide he follows than a later dramatist would be. He takes the
text of his author, and often he has not more than one: he accepts it
implicitly and will not willingly distort it: he reads it in the light
of his own insight and the spirit of the age, and tries to recreate the
agents and the story from the more or less adequate hints that he finds.</p>

<p>Now, proceeding in this way it is clear that while in every case
Shakespeare’s indebtedness to his historical sources must be great,
it will vary greatly in quality and degree according to the material
delivered to him. The situations may be more or less dramatic, the
narrative more or less firmly conceived. And among his sources Plutarch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
occupies quite an exceptional place. From no one else has he ‘conveyed’
so much, and no one else has he altered so little. And the reason
is, that save Chaucer and Homer, on whom he drew for <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>, but from whom he could assimilate little that suited
his own different ideas, no other writer contained so much that was
of final and permanent excellence. To put it shortly, in Plutarch’s
<i>Lives</i> Shakespeare for the first and almost the only time was
rehandling the masterpieces of a genius who stood at the summit of
his art. It was not so in the English Histories. One does not like to
say a word in disparagement of the Elizabethan chronicles, especially
Holinshed’s, on which the maturer plays are based. They are good
reading and deserve to be read independently of the dramatist’s use of
them. But they are not works of phenomenal ability, and they betray the
infancy of historical writing, not only in scientific method, which
in the present connection would hardly matter, but in narrative art
as well. Cowley in <i>his</i> Chronicle, <i>i.e.</i> the imaginary
record of his love affairs, breaks off with a simile and jest at their
expense. If, he says, I were to give the details,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I more voluminous should grow—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">(Chiefly if I like them should tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">All change of weathers that befell)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than Holinshed and Stowe.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Their intention is good, and they often realise it so as to interest
and impress, but the introduction of such-like trifles as Cowley
mentions, without much relevance or significance, may give us the
measure of their technical skill. Again, though in the second and third
part of <i>Henry VI.</i> Shakespeare was dealing with the work of
Marlowe, we have to remember, first, that his originals were composite
pieces not by Marlowe alone, and, further, that even Marlowe could not
altogether escape the disabilities of a pioneer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>In Plutarch, however, Shakespeare levied toll on no petty vassal like
the compilers of the Chronicles, or innovating conqueror like the
author of <i>Tamburlaine</i>, but on the king by right divine of a
long-established realm. And the result is that he appropriates more,
and that more of greater value, than from any other tributary.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">ANCESTRY OF SHAKESPEARE’S ROMAN PLAYS</span></h3>
</div>

<h4>1. PLUTARCH<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></h4>

<p>Plutarch, born at Chaeronea in Boeotia, about 45 or 50 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
flourished in the last quarter of the first and the earliest quarter
of the second century. He came of good stock, which he is not
reluctant to talk about. Indeed, his habit of introducing or quoting
his father, his grandfather, and even his great grandfather, gives us
glimpses of a home in which the prescribed pieties of family life were
warmly cherished; and some of the references imply an atmosphere of
simplicity, urbanity, and culture.</p>

<p>The lad was sent to Athens to complete his education under Ammonius,
an eminent philosopher of that generation, though in Carlyle’s phrase,
‘now dim to us,’ who also took part in what little administrative
work was still intrusted to provincials, and more than once held the
distinguished position of strategos. Thus, as in childhood Plutarch was
trained in the best domestic traditions of elder Greece, so now he had
before his eyes an example of such active citizenship as survived in
the changed condition of things.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>The same spirit of reverence for the past presided over his routine of
study. His works afterwards show a wide familiarity with the earlier
literature and philosophy of his country, and the foundations of this
must have been laid in his student days. It was still in accordance
with accepted precedents and his own reminiscent tastes, that when he
set out on his travels, he should first, as so many of his predecessors
were reported to have done, betake himself to the storied land of
Egypt. We know that this must have been after 66 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, for in
that year, when Nero made his progress through Greece, Plutarch tells
us that he was still the pupil of Ammonius. We know, further, that he
must have visited Alexandria, for he mentions that in his grandfather’s
opinion his father gave too large a banquet to celebrate their
homecoming from that city. But he does not inform us how much of Egypt
he saw, or how long was his stay, or in what way he employed himself.
It is only a probable conjecture at most that his treatise on <i>Isis
and Osiris</i> may be one of the fruits of this expedition.</p>

<p>Of another and later journey that took him to Italy, there is more to
be said. Plutarch at an early age, whether before or after the Egyptian
tour, had already been employed in public affairs. He tells us:</p>

<p class="blockquot">I remember my selfe, that when I was but of yoong
yeres I was sent with another in embassage to the Proconsul: and in
that my companion staid about I wot not what behind, I went alone and
did that which we had in commission to do together. After my returne
when I was to give an account unto the State, and to report the effect
of my charge and message back again, my father arose, and taking me
apart, willed me in no wise to speak in the singular number and say,
<i>I departed or went</i>, but, <i>We departed</i>; item not <i>I
said</i> (or <i>quoth I</i>) but <i>We said</i>; and in the whole
narration of the rest to joine alwaies my companion as if he had been
associated and at one hand with me in that which I did
alone.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
Such courtesy conciliates good will, and he was subsequently sent ‘on
public business’ to Rome. This must have been before 90 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>,
when Rusticus, whom Plutarch mentions that he met, was condemned to
death, and when the philosophers were expelled from the city; and was
probably some time after 74 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, the date of their
previous expulsion, when, moreover, Plutarch was too young to be charged with
matters so weighty as to need settlement in the capital. But it is not
certain whether this was his only visit to Italy, and whether he made
it in the reign of Vespasian or of Domitian. His story of a performing
dog that took part in an exhibition in presence of Vespasian, has
been thought to have the verisimilitude of a witnessed scene, and has
been used to support the former supposition: his description of the
sumptuousness of Domitian’s buildings makes a similar impression, and
has been used to support the latter. All this must remain doubtful,
but some things are certain: that his business was so engrossing, and
those who came to him for instruction were so numerous, that he had
little time for the study of the Latin language; that he delivered
lectures, some of which were the first drafts of essays subsequently
included in the <i>Moralia</i>; that he had as his acquaintances or
auditors several of the most distinguished men in Rome, among them
Mestrius Florus, a table companion of Vespasian, Sosius Senecio, the
correspondent of Pliny, and that Arulenus Rusticus afterwards put to
death by Domitian, who on one occasion would not interrupt a lecture of
Plutarch’s to read a letter from the Emperor; that he traversed Italy
as far north as Ravenna, where he saw the bust of Marius, and even as
Bedriacum, where he inspected the battlefields of 69 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span></p>

<p>But though Plutarch loved travel and sight-seeing, and though he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
fully alive to the advantages of a great city, with its instructive
society and its collections of books, his heart was in his native
place, and he returned to settle there. “I my selfe,” he says, “dwelle
in a poore little towne, and yet doe remayne there willingly, least it
should become lesse.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
And in point of fact he seems henceforth only to have left it for short
excursions to various parts of Greece. One of these exhibits him in a
characteristic and amiable light. Apparently soon after his marriage a
dispute had broken out between the parents of the newly wedded pair,
and Plutarch in his conciliatory way took his wife, as we should say,
‘on a pilgrimage,’ to the shrine at Thespiae on Mount Helicon to offer
a sacrifice to Love.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
This is in keeping with all the express utterances and all the
unconscious revelations he makes of his feeling for the sacredness
of the family tie. He was one of those whose soul rings true to the
claims of kith and kin. He thanks Fortune as a chief favour for
the comradeship of his brother Timon, and delights to show off the
idiosyncrasies of his brother Lamprias. We do not know when his
marriage took place, but if Plutarch acted on his avowed principles,
it must have been when he was still a young man, and it was a very
happy one. As we should expect; for of all the affections it is wedded
love that he dwells on most fully, and few have spoken more nobly and
sincerely of it than he. Again and again he gives the point of view,
which is often said to have been attained by the Modern World only by
the combined assistance of Germanic character and Christian religion.
Thus he says of a virtuous attachment:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> But looke what person soever love setleth upon in
mariage, so as he be inspired once therewith, at the very first, like
as it is in Platoes Common-wealth, he will not have these words in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
mouth, <i>Mine</i> and <i>Thine</i>; for simply all goods are not
common among all friends, but only those who being severed apart
in body, conjoine and colliquate as it were perforce their soules
together, neither willing nor believing that they should be twaine
but one: and afterward by true pudicitie and reverence one unto the
other, whereof wedlock hath most need.... In true love there is so much
continency, modesty, loyalty and faithfulnesse, that though otherwhile
it touche a wanton and lascivious minde, yet it diverteth it from other
lovers, and by cutting off all malapert boldnesse, by taking downe and
debasing insolent pride and untaught stubornesse, it placeth in lieu
thereof modest bashfulnesse, silence, and taciturnity; it adorneth it
with decent gesture and seemly countenance, making it for ever after
obedient to one lover onely.... For like as at Rome, when there was a
Lord Dictatour once chosen, all other officers of state and magistrates
valed bonnet, were presently deposed, and laied downe their ensignes
of authority; even so those over whom love hath gotten the mastery and
rule, incontinently are quit freed and delivered from all other lords
and rulers, no otherwise than such as are devoted to the service of
some religious place.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>His wife bore him at least five children, of whom three died in
childhood, the eldest son, “the lovely Chaeron,” and then their little
daughter, born after her four brothers, and called by her mother’s
name, Timoxena. The letter of comfort which Plutarch, who was absent
at Tanagra, sent home after the death took place, is good to read.
There is perhaps here and there a touch that suggests the professional
moralist and rhetorician: as when he recounts a fable of Aesop’s
to enforce his advice; or bids his wife not to dwell on her griefs
rather than her blessings, like “those Criticks who collect and gather
together all the lame and defective verses of Homer, which are but few
in number; and in the meane time passe over an infinite sort of others
which were by him most excellently made”; or warns her to look to her
health because, if “the bodie be evill entreated and not regarded with
good diet and choice keeping, it becometh dry, rough and hard, in such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
sort as from it there breathe no sweet and comfortable exhalations
unto the soule, but all smoakie and bitter vapors of dolour griefe
and sadnesse annoy her.” These were the toll Plutarch paid to his age
and to his training. But the tender feeling for his wife’s grief, and
the confidence in her dignified endurance of it are very beautiful
and human. And his descriptions of the child’s sweet nature, which
he does not leave general, but after his wont lights up with special
reminiscences, and which, he insists, they must not lose from mind or
turn to bitterness but cherish as an abiding joy, strike the note that
is still perhaps most comforting to mourners. After telling over her
other winsome and gracious ways, he recalls:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>She was of a wonderfull kinde and gentle nature; loving she was
againe to those that loved her, and marvellous desirous to gratifie
and pleasure others: in which regards she both delighted me and also
yielded no small testimonie of rare debonairetie that nature had endued
her withall; for she would make pretie means<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
to her nourse, and seeme (as it were) to intreat her to give the brest
or pap, not only to other infants but also to little babies<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and puppets and
such-like gauds as little ones take joy in and wherewith they use to
play; as if upon a singular courtesie and humanitie shee could finde in
her heart to communicate and distribute from her owne table even the
best things that shee had, among them that did her any pleasure. But I
see no reason (sweet wife) why these lovely qualities and such like,
wherein we took contentment and joy in her life time, should disquiet

<p>And then there is the confident expectation of immortality to mitigate
the present pang of severance.</p>

<p>But Plutarch and his wife had other consolations as well. Two sons,
Aristobulus and a younger Plutarch, lived to be men, and to them he
dedicated a treatise on the <i>Timaeus</i>. We know that one of them
at least married and had a son in his father’s lifetime. Beyond his
domestic circle Plutarch had a large number of friends in Chaeronea
and elsewhere, including such distinguished names as Favorinus the
philosopher and Serapion the poet; and being, in Dr. Johnson’s
phrase, an eminently “clubbable man,” he was often host and guest
at banquets, fragments of the talk at which he has preserved in his
<i>Symposiacs</i>. Almost the only rigorous line in his portrait is
contributed by Aulus Gellius, his later contemporary, and the friend of
their common friend Favorinus. Gellius<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
represents the philosopher Taurus as telling about “Plutarchus
noster”—a phrase that shows the attachment men felt for him—a story
of which Dryden gives the following free and amplified but very racy
translation:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Plutarch had a certain slave, a saucy stubborn
kind of fellow; in a word one of these pragmatical servants who never
make a fault but they give a reason for it. His justifications one time
would not serve his turn, but his master commanded that he should be
stripped and that the law should be laid on his back. He no sooner felt
the smart but he muttered that he was unjustly punished, and that he
had done nothing to deserve the scourge. At last he began to bawl out
louder; and leaving off his groaning, his sighs, and his lamentations,
to argue the matter with more show of reason: and, as under such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
master he must needs have gained a smattering of learning, he cried out
that Plutarch was not the philosopher he pretended himself to be; that
he had heard him waging war against all the passions, and maintaining
that anger was unbecoming a wise man; nay, that he had written a
particular treatise in commendation of clemency; that therefore he
contradicted his precepts by his practices, since, abandoning himself
over to his choler, he exercised such inhuman cruelty on the body of
his fellow-creature. “How is this, Mr. Varlet?” (answered Plutarch).
“By what signs and tokens can you prove that I am in passion? Is it by
my countenance, my voice, the colour of my face, by my words or by my
gestures that you have discovered this my fury? I am not of opinion
that my eyes sparkle, that I foam at the mouth, that I gnash my teeth,
or that my voice is more vehement, or that my colour is either more
pale or more red than at other times; that I either shake or stamp with
madness; that I say or do anything unbecoming a philosopher. These, if
you know them not, are the symptoms of a man in rage. In the meantime,”
(turning to the officer who scourged him) “while he and I dispute this
matter, mind your business on his back.”</p>

<p>This story, as we have seen, comes from one who was in a position to
get authentic information about Plutarch, and it may very well be
true; but it should be corrected, or at least supplemented, by his own
utterances in regard to his servants. “Sometimes,” he says, “I use to
get angry with my slaves, but at last I saw that it was better to spoil
them by indulgence, than to injure myself by rage in the effort to
amend them.” And more emphatically:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> As for me I coulde never finde in my hart to
sell my drawght Oxe that hadde plowed my lande a longe time, because
he coulde plowe no longer for age; and much lesse my slave to sell
him for a litle money, out of the contrie where he had dwelt a long
time, to plucke him from his olde trade of life wherewith he was best
acquainted, and then specially, when he shalbe as unprofitable for the
buyer as also for the seller.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch was thus fully alive to the social and domestic amenities of
life, and to his responsibilities as householder, but he did not for
them overlook other claims. He became priest of Apollo in Delphi, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
for many years fulfilled the priestly functions, taking part in the
sacrifices, processions and dances even as an old man; for philosopher
as he was, his very philosophy supplied him with various contrivances
for conformity with the ancient cult, and he probably had no more
difficulty about it than a modern Hegelian has with the Thirty-nine
Articles. His deeper religious needs would be satisfied by the
Mysteries, in which he and his wife were initiated.</p>

<p>He was equally assiduous in public duties, which he did not despise
for the pettiness to which under the Roman domination they had shrunk.
In his view even the remnants of self-government are to be jealously
guarded and loyally employed, though they may concern merely parochial
and municipal affairs, and for them vigilant training and discipline
are required.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Surely impossible it is that they should ever
have their part of any great roial and magnificall joy, such as indeed
causeth magnanimitie and hautinesse of courage, bringeth glorious
honour abroad or tranquillitie of spirit at home, who have made choice
of a close and private life within doors, never showing themselves in
the world nor medling with publicke affaires of common weale; a life,
I say, sequestered from all offices of humanitie, far removed from any
instinct of honour or desire to gratifie others, thereby to deserve
thankes or winne favour: for the soul, I may tell you, is no base and
small thing; it is not vile and illiberal, extending her desires onely
to that which is good to be eaten, as doe these poulpes<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
or pour cuttle fishes which stretch their cleies as far as to their
meat and no farther: for such appetites as these are most quickly
cut off with satietie and filled in a moment. But when the motives
and desires of the minde tending to vertue and honestie, to honour
and contentment of conscience are once growen to their vigour and
perfection, they have not for their limit, the length and tearme onely
of one man’s life; but surely the desire of honour and the affection
to profit the societie of men, comprehending all aeternitie, striveth
still to goe forward in such actions and beneficiall deedes as yield
infinite pleasures that cannot be expressed.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
He was true to his principles. He not only officiated as Archon of
Chaeronea, but, “gracing the lowliest act in doing it,” was willing to
discharge the functions of a more subordinate post, which some thought
beneath his dignity.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Mine answer is to such as reprove me, when they
find me in proper person present, at the measuring and counting of
bricks and tiles, or to see the stones, sand and lime laid downe, which
is brought into the citie: “It is not for myselfe that I builde, but
for the citie and commonwealth.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>He was thus faithful over a few things; tradition made him ruler over
many things. It is related that Trajan granted him consular rank and
directed the governor of Achaia to avail himself of his advice. This
was embellished by the report that he had been Trajan’s preceptor; and
in the Middle Ages a letter very magisterial in tone was fabricated
from him to his imperial pupil. It was even said that in his old age
Hadrian had made him governor of Greece.</p>

<p>There is a poetic justification for such legends. The government of
Trajan and Hadrian was felt to be such that the precepts of philosophy
might very fittingly have inspired it, and that the philosopher might
very well have been the administrator of their policy. And indeed it
is perhaps no fable that Plutarch had something to do with the better
<i>régime</i> that was commencing; for his nephew Sextus of Chaeronea,
who may have inherited something of his uncle’s spirit, was an honoured
teacher of Marcus Aurelius, and influenced his pupil by his example
no less than by his teaching. The social renovation which was then in
progress should be remembered in estimating Plutarch’s career. Gibbon
says: “If a man were called to fix the period in the History of the
World, during which the condition of the human race was most happy and
prosperous, he would, without hesitation, name that which elapsed from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus.” Probably this
statement would need to be, if not greatly qualified, at least greatly
amplified, before it commanded universal assent, but, as it stands,
there is a truth in it which anyone can perceive. There was peace
throughout a great portion of the world; there was good government
within the Empire; there was a rejuvenescence of antique culture,
literature, and conduct. Indeed, the upward tendency begins with
the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, and even the thwarting influence
of Domitian’s principate would be felt in Rome rather than in the
provinces. It was in this time of “reaction against corruption” that
Plutarch flourished, and his later life especially fell well within
that Indian summer of classical civilisation that Gibbon celebrates.
The tradition that he survived till the accession of Antonine may be
incorrect, but he certainly enjoyed eight years of Trajan’s government,
and, by Eusebius’ statement, was still alive in the third year of
Hadrian’s reign. It is to his latter days that his <i>Lives</i> as
a whole are assigned, partly on account of the casual reference to
contemporary events that some of them contain.</p>

<p>Plutarch’s character, circumstances, and career in a world which was
reaching its close, well fitted him for the work that he did. This
Greek citizen of the Roman Empire had cultivated his mind by study and
travel, and had assimilated the wisdom of wide experience and pregnant
memories which Antiquity had amassed in earlier times and to which this
interval of revival was heir. Benevolent and dutiful, temperate and
devout, with a deep sense of his public obligations and the ethos of
his race, he sympathised with the best principles that had moulded the
life of olden days, and that were emerging to direct the life of the
present. And he combined his amplitude of traditional lore and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
enthusiasm for traditional virtue in a way that made him more than
an antiquary or a moralist. The explorer and practitioner of antique
ideas, in a sense he was their artist as well.</p>

<p>His treatment and style already suggest the manifold influences that
went to form his mind. One of his charms lies in his quotations, which
he culls, or rather which spring up of their own accord, from his
reading of the most various authors of the most different times. He is
at home in Greek literature, and likes to clinch his argument with a
saying from the poets, for he seems to find that their words put his
thought better than he could himself. But this affects his original
expression. Dryden writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Being conversant in so great a variety of authors,
and collecting from all of them what he thought most excellent, out
of the confusion or rather mixture of their styles he formed his own,
which partaking of each was yet none of them, but a compound of them
all:—like the Corinthian metal which had in it gold and brass and
silver, and yet was a species in itself.</p>

<p>There may be a suggestion of the curious mosaic-worker in his
procedure, something of artifice, or at least of conscious art; and
indeed his treatises are not free from a rhetorical and sometimes
declamatory strain.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
That in so far is what Courier means when he says that Plutarch writes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
in the style of a <i>sophistes</i>; but it was inseparable from his
composite culture and academic training, and it does not interfere with
his sincerity and directness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
His philosophy makes a similar impression. He is an eclectic or
syncretist, and has learned from many of the mighty teachers of
bygone times. Plato is his chief authority, but Plato’s doctrines are
consciously modified in an Aristotelian sense, while nevertheless those
aspects of them are made prominent which were afterwards elaborated
by Neo-Platonism strictly so-called. But Plutarch, though he has the
good word of Neo-Platonic thinkers, is not himself to be reckoned
of their company. He is comparatively untouched by their mysticism,
borrowed freely from the Theosophy of the East, and he stands in closer
lineal relation to the antique Greek spirit than some, like Philo, who
precede him in time. He was so indifferent to the Semitic habit of
mind that, despite his almost omnivorous curiosity, he never thought
it worth while to instruct himself in the exact nature of Judaism or
its difference from the Syrian cult, far less to spend on Christianity
so much as a passing glance. He approaches Neo-Platonism most nearly
in certain religious imaginings which, as he himself recognised, have
affinity with beliefs which prevailed in Persia and Egypt; but even
so, he hardly ceases to be national, for these were the two countries
with which in days of yore Greece had the most important historic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
connections. And moreover, his interest in such surmises is not, in
the first place, a speculative one, but springs from the hope of his
finding some explanation of and comfort for the trials and difficulties
of actual life. For on the whole he differs from Plato chiefly in
his subordination of theory to practice. This compels him to accept
loans from the very schools that he most criticises, the Stoics, the
Sceptics, the Epicureans themselves. It is his preoccupation with
conduct, rather than eclectic debility, that makes him averse to
any one-sided scheme, and inclined to supplement it with manifold
additions. But as in his style, so in his thought, he blends the
heterogeneous elements to his own purpose, and fixes on them the stamp
of his own mind. It is not without reason that his various treatises
are included under the common title of <i>Moralia</i>. He may dilate on
the worship of <i>Isis and Osiris</i>, or <i>The Face appearing within
the Roundle of the Moone</i>; he may discuss <i>Whether creatures
be more wise, they of the land or those of the water</i>; <i>What
signifieth this word Ei engraven over the Dore of Appolloes Temple in
the City of Delphi</i>, and various other recondite matters; but the
prevailing impression is ethical, and he is at his best when he is
discoursing expressly on some moral theme, on <i>Unseemly and Naughty
Bashfulnesse</i>, or <i>Brotherly Love</i>, or <i>Tranquillitie and
Contentment of Mind</i>, or the <i>Pluralitie of Friends</i>, or the
question <i>Whether this common Mot be well said ‘Live Hidden.’</i>
There is the background of serious study and philosophic knowledge,
but against it is detached the figure of the sagacious and practical
teacher, who wishes to make his readers better men and better women,
but never forgets his urbanity and culture in his admonitions, and
drives them home with pointed anecdote and apt quotation. And the
substance of his teaching, though so sane and experimental that it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
sometimes described as obvious and trite, has a generous, ideal, and
even chivalrous strain, when he touches on such subjects as love,
or devotion, or the claims of virtue; and his sympathy goes out
spontaneously to noble words or deeds or minds.</p>

<p>It is an easy step from the famous <i>Moralia</i> to the still more
famous <i>Parallel Lives</i>. “All history,” says Dryden, in reference
to the latter, “is only the precepts of moral philosophy reduced
into examples.” This, at least, is no bad description of Plutarch’s
point of view; and his methods do not greatly differ in the series of
essays and in the series of biographies. In the essays he did not let
himself be unduly hampered by the etiquette of the Moral Treatise, but
expatiated at will among Collections and Recollections, and embroidered
his abstract argument with the stories that he delights to tell.
As historian, on the other hand, he is not tied down to historical
narration and exposition, but indulges his moralising bent to the full.
He is on the lookout for edification, and is seldom at a loss for a peg
to hang a lecture on. And these discourses of his, though the material
is sometimes the sober drab of the decent <i>bourgeois</i>, are always
fine in texture, and relieved by the quaintness of the cut and the
ingenuity of the garnishing: nor are they the less interesting that
they do not belong to the regulation historical outfit. Such improving
digressions, indeed, are among Plutarch’s charms. “I am always
pleased,” says Dryden, “when I see him and his imitator Montaigne when
they strike a little out of the common road; for we are sure to be the
better for their wandering. The best quarry does not always lie on the
open field, and who would not be content to follow a good huntsman over
hedges and ditches, when he knows the game will reward his
pains.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Proceeding in this way it is not to be expected that Plutarch should
compose his <i>Lives</i> with much care for dexterous design. Just as
in his philosophy he has no rigidly consequent system of doctrine,
so in his biographies he has no orderly or well-digested plan. The
excellences that arise from a definite and vigorous conception of the
whole are not those at which he aims. He would proceed very much at
haphazard, were it not for the chronological clue; which, for the rest,
he is very willing to abandon if a tempting by-path presents itself,
or if he thinks of something for which he must retrace his steps. Yet,
no more than in his metaphysics is he without an instinctive method of
his own. The house is finished, and with all its irregularities it is
good to dwell in; the journey is ended, and there has been no monotony
on the devious track. There is this advantage indeed in his procedure
over that of more systematic biographers, that it offers hospitality to
all the suggestions that crowd for admission. None is rejected because
it is out of place and insignificant. Gossip and allotria of every kind
that do not make out their claims at first sight, and that the more
ambitious historian would exclude as trivial, find an entry if they can
show a far-off connection with the subject. And, lo and behold, they
often turn out to be the most instructive of all.</p>

<p>But Plutarch welcomes them without scrutinising them very austerely. He
submits their credentials to no stringent test. He is no severe critic
of their authenticity. He takes them where he finds them, just as he
picks up philosophic ideas from all quarters, even from the detested
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
Epicureans, without condemning them on account of their suspicious
source: it is enough for him if they adapt themselves to his use.
Nor does he educe from them all that they involve. He does not even
confront them with each other, to examine whether opposite hints about
his heroes may not lead to fuller and subtler conceptions of them. This
is the point of the charge brought against him by St. Évremond, that
he might have carried his analysis further and penetrated more deeply
into human nature. St. Évremond notes how different a man is from
himself, the same person being just and unjust, merciful and cruel;
“which qualities,” proceeds the critic, “seeming to belie each other
in him, [Plutarch] attributes these inconsistencies to foreign causes.
He could never ... reconcile contrarieties in the same subject.” He
never tried to do so. He collects a number of vivid traits, which,
like a number of minute lines, set forth the likeness to his own mind,
but he is ordinarily as far from interrogating and combining his
impressions as he is from subjecting them to any punctilious test. He
exhibits characters in the particular aspects and manifestations which
history or hearsay has presented, and is content with the general
sense of verisimilitude that these successive indications, credited
or accredited, have left behind. But he stops there, and does not
study his manifold data to construct from them a consistent complex
individuality in its oneness and difference. And if this is true of him
as biographer, it is still truer of him as historian. He touches on all
sorts of historical subjects—war, policy, administration, government;
and he has abundance of acute and just remarks on them all. But it is
not in these that his chief interest lies, and it is not over them that
he holds his torch. This does not mean that he fails to perceive the
main drift of things or to appreciate the importance of statecraft. Mr.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Wyndham, defending him against those who have “denied him any political
insight,” very justly shows that, despite “the paucity of his political
pronouncements,” he has a “political bent.” His choice of heroes, in
the final arrangement to which they lent themselves, proves that he
has an eye for the general course of Greek and Roman history, for the
impotence into which the city state is sunk by rivalry with neighbours
in the one case, for its transmutation into an Empire on the other:
“The tragedy of Athens, the drama of Rome,” says Mr. Wyndham, “these
are the historic poles of the <i>Parallel Lives</i>.” And Plutarch has
a political ideal: the “need of authority and the obligation of the
few to maintain it—by a ‘natural grace’ springing on the one hand
from courage combined with forbearance, and leading, on the other, to
harmony between the rulers and the ruled—is the text, which, given
out in the <i>Lycurgus</i>, is illustrated throughout the <i>Parallel
Lives</i>.” So much indeed we had a right to expect from the thoughtful
patriot and experienced magistrate of Chaeronea. The salient outlines
of the story of Greece and Rome could hardly remain hidden from a
clear-sighted man with Plutarch’s knowledge of the past: the relations
of governor and governed had not only engaged him practically, but had
suggested to him one of his most pithy essays, <i>Praecepta gerendae
Reipublicae</i>, a title which Philemon Holland paraphrases in stricter
accordance with the contents, <i>Instructions for them that manage
Affaires of State</i>. But this does not carry us very far. Shakespeare
in his English Histories shows at least as much political discernment
and political instinct. He brings out the general lesson of the wars of
Lancaster and York, and in <i>Henry V.</i> gives his conception of the
ideal ruler. But no one would say that this series shows a conspicuous
genius for political research or political history. The same thing is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
true, and in a greater degree, of Plutarch. He is public-spirited,
but he is not a publicist. He has not much concern or understanding
for particular measures and movements and problems, however critical
they may be. It is impossible to challenge the justice of Archbishop
Trench’s verdict, either in its general scope or in its particular
instances, when he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">One who already knows the times of Marius and
Sulla will obtain a vast amount of instruction from his several
<i>Lives</i> of these, will clothe with flesh and blood what would
else, in some parts, have been the mere skeleton of a story; but I
am bold to say no one would understand those times from him. The
suppression of the Catilinarian Conspiracy was the most notable event
in the life of Cicero; but one rises from Plutarch’s <i>Life</i>
with only the faintest impression of what that conspiracy, a sort of
anticipation of the French Commune, and having objects social rather
than political, meant. Or take his <i>Lives</i> of the Gracchi.
Admirable in many respects as these are, greatly as we are debtors to
him here for important facts, whereof otherwise we should have been
totally ignorant, few, I think, would affirm that he at all plants them
in a position for understanding that vast revolution effected, with the
still vaster revolution attempted by them, and for ever connected with
their names. </p>

<p>In Plutarch the historian, as well as the biographer, is subordinate to
the ethical teacher who wishes to enforce lessons that may be useful to
men in the management of their lives. He gathers his material for its
“fine moral effects,” not for “purposes of research.”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
Plutarch, then, had already composed many disquisitions to commend his
humane and righteous ideas, and it was partly in the same didactic
spirit that he seems to have written his <i>Parallel Lives</i>. At the
beginning of the <i>Life of Pericles</i> he says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Vertue is of this power, that she allureth a mans
minde presently to use her, and maketh him very desirous in his harte
to followe her: and doth not frame his manners that beholdeth her by
any imitation but by the only understanding and knowledge of vertuous
deedes, which sodainely bringeth unto him a resolute desire to doe the
like. <i>And this is the reason why methought I should continew
still to write on the lives of noble men.</i></p>

<p>And similar statements occur again and again. They clearly show the
aim that he consciously had in view. The new generation was to be
admonished and renovated by the examples of the leading spirits who
had flourished in former times. And since he was addressing the whole
civilised world, he took his examples both from Roman and from Grecian
History, and arranged his persons in pairs, each pair supplying the
matter for one book. Thus he couples Theseus and Romulus, Alcibiades
and Coriolanus, Alexander and Caesar, Dion and Brutus, Demetrius and
Antony. Such parallelism is a little far-fetched, and though some of
the detailed comparisons with which it is justified, are not from
Plutarch’s hand, and belong to a later time, it of itself betrays
a certain fondness for symmetry and antithesis, a leaning towards
artifice and rhetoric which, as we have seen, the author owed to his
environment. He wishes in an eloquent way to inculcate his lessons,
and is perhaps, for the same reason, somewhat prone to exaggerate the
greatness of the past, and show it in an idealised light. But this is
by no means the pose of the histrionic revivalist. It corresponds to
an authentic sentiment in his own nature, which loved to linger amid
the glooms and glories of tradition, and pay vows at the shrine of the
Great Departed. “The cradle of war and statecraft,” says Mr. Wyndham,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
“was become a memory dear to him, and ever evolved by his personal
contact with the triumphs of Rome. From this contrast flowed his
inspiration for the <i>Parallel Lives</i>—his desire as a man to draw
the noble Grecians, long since dead, a little nearer to the noon-day of
the living; his delight as an artist in setting the noble Romans, whose
names were in every mouth, a little further into the twilight of more
ancient Romance.”</p>

<p>But this transfiguration of the recent and resurrection of the remoter
past, in which Mr. Wyndham rightly sees something “romantic,” does
not lay Plutarch open to the charge of vagueness or unreality. He was
saved from such vices by his interest in human nature and suggestive
<i>ana</i> and picturesque incidents on the one hand, and by his
deference for political history and civil society on the other.</p>

<p>He loved marked individualities: no two of his heroes are alike, and
each, though in a varying degree, has an unmistakable physiognomy of
his own. There is no sameness in his gallery of biographies, and even
the legends of demigods yield figures of firm outline that resist the
touch. This is largely due to his joy in details, and the imperious
demand his imagination makes for them. In his <i>Life of Alexander</i>
he uses words which very truly describe his own method, words which
Boswell<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
was afterwards to quote in justification of his own similar procedure.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The noblest deedes doe not alwayes shew men’s

<p>So he likes to give the familiar traits and emphasise the suggestive
nothings that best discover character. But his purpose is almost
always to discover character, and, so far as his principal persons
are concerned, to discover great character. Though so assiduous in
sharking up their mannerisms, foibles, and oddities, their tricks of
gait or speech or costume, he is not like the Man with the Muck Rake,
and is not piling together the rubbish of tittle-tattle just because
he has a soul for nothing higher. Still less does he take the valet’s
view of the hero, and hold that he is no hero at all because he can
be seen in undress or in relations that show his common human nature.
Reverence for greatness is the point from which he starts, reverence
for greatness is the star that guides his course, and his reverence is
so entire, that on the one hand he welcomes all that will help him to
restore the great one in his speech and habit as he lived, and on the
other, he assumes that the greatness must pervade the whole life, and
that flashes of glory will be refracted from the daily talk and walk.
Like Carlyle, though in a more <i>naïf</i> and simple way, he is a
hero-worshipper; like Carlyle he believes that the hero will not lose
but gain by the record of his minutest traits, and that these will only
throw new light on his essential heroism. In the object he proposed
to himself he has succeeded well. “Plutarch,” says Rousseau, almost
reproducing the biographer’s own words, “has inimitable dexterity
in painting great men in little things, and he is so happy in his
selection, that often a phrase, a simile, a gesture suffices him to set
forth a hero. That is the true art of portraiture. The physiognomy does
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
not display itself in the main lines, nor the characters in great
actions; it is in trifles that the temperament discloses itself.”
An interesting testimony; for Rousseau, when he sets up as
character-painter, belongs to a very different school.</p>

<p>It is not otherwise with his narratives of actions or his descriptions
of scenes, if action or scene really interest him; and there is little
of intrinsic value, comic or tragic, vivacious or stately, familiar or
weird, that does not interest him. Under his quick successive strokes,
some of them so light that at first they evade notice, some of them
so simple that at first they seem commonplace, the situation becomes
visible and luminous. He knows how to choose the accessories and what
to do with them. When our attention is awakened, we ask ourselves how
he has produced the effect by means apparently so insignificant; and we
cannot answer. Here he may have selected a hint from his authorities,
there he may derive another from the mental vision he himself has
evoked, but in either case the result is equally wonderful. Whether
from his tact in reporting or his energy in imagining, he contrives to
make us view the occurrence as a fact, and a fact that is like itself
and like nothing else.</p>

<p>But again Plutarch was saved from wanton and empty phantasms by his
political bias. He was not a politician or a statesman or an historian
of politics or institutions, but he was a citizen with a citizen’s
respect for the State. “For himself,” to quote Mr. Wyndham once more,
“he was painting individual character, and he sought it among men
bearing a personal stamp. But he never sought it in a private person,
or a comedian, nor even in a poet or a master of the Fine Arts.” He
confines himself to public men, as we should call them, and never fails
to recollect that they played their part on the public stage. And this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
not only gave a robustness of touch and breadth of stroke to his
delineations; the connection with well-known and certified events
preserved him from the worst licenses to which the romantic and
rhetorical temper is liable. Courier, indeed, says of him that he was
“capable of making Pompey win the battle of Pharsalia, if it would have
rounded his sentence ever so little.” But though he may be credulous
of details and manipulate his copy, and with a light heart make one
statement at one time and a different one at another, the sort of
liberty Courier attributes to him is precisely the one he does not
take. Facts are stubborn things, and the great outstanding facts he is
careful to observe: they bring a good deal else in their train.</p>

<p>A book like the <i>Parallel Lives</i> was bound to achieve a great
popularity at the Renaissance. That it was full of instruction and
served for warning and example commended it to a generation that was
but too inclined to prize the didactic in literature. Its long list of
worthies included not a few of the names that were being held up as the
greatest in human history, and these celebrities were exhibited not
aloft on their official pedestals, but, however impressive and imposing
the <i>mise-en-scène</i> might be, as men among men in the private and
personal passages of their lives. And yet they were not private persons
but historical magnates, the founders or leaders of world-renowned
states: and as such they were particularly congenial to an age in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
many of the best minds—More and Buchanan, L’Hôpital and La Boëtie,
Brand and Hutten—were awakening to the antique idea of civic and
political manhood, and finding few unalloyed examples of it in the
feudalised West. It was not enough that Plutarch was made more
accessible in the Latin form. He deserved a vernacular dress, and after
various tentative experiments this was first satisfactorily, in truth,
admirably, supplied by Bishop Amyot in France.</p>

<p>Jacques Amyot was born in October, 1513, in Melun, the little town on
the Seine, some thirty miles to the south-east of Paris. His parents
were very poor, but at any rate from his earliest years he was within
the sweep of the dialect of the Île de France, and had no <i>patois</i>
to unlearn when he afterwards appeared as a literary man. Perhaps
to this is due some of the purity and correctness which the most
fastidious were afterwards to celebrate in his style. These influences
would be confirmed when as a lad he proceeded to Paris to pursue his
studies. His instructors in Greek were—first, Evagrius, in the college
of Cardinal Lemoine, and afterwards, Thusan and Danès, who, at the
instance of Budaeus, had just been appointed <i>lecteurs royaux</i> in
Ancient Philosophy and Literature. Stories are told of the privations
that he endured in the pursuit of scholarship, how his mother sent him
every week a loaf by the watermen of the Seine, how he read his books
by the light of the fire, and the like; but similar circumstances are
related of others, and, to quote Sainte Beuve, are in some sort “the
legend of the heroic age of erudition.” It is better authenticated
that he supported himself by becoming the domestic attendant of richer
students till he graduated as Master of Arts at the age of nineteen.
Then his position began to improve. He became tutor in important
households, to the nephews of the Royal Reader, and to the children of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the Royal Secretary. Through such patrons his ability and knowledge
were made known to the King’s sister, Marguérite de Valois, the
beneficent patroness of literature and learning. He had proceeded to
Bourges, it is said, to study law, but by her influence was appointed
to discharge the more congenial functions of Reader in the Greek and
Latin Languages, and was soon promoted to the full professorship. The
University of Bourges was at the time the youngest in France save that
of Bordeaux, having been founded less than three-quarters of a century
before in 1463, when the Renaissance was advancing from conquest to
conquest in Italy, and when Medievalism was moribund even in France.
The new institution would have few traditions to oppose to the new
spirit, and there was scope for a missionary of the New Learning. For
some ten or twelve years Amyot remained in his post, lecturing two
hours daily, in the morning on Latin, in the afternoon on Greek. No
doubt such instruction would be elementary in a way; but even so, it
was a laborious life, for in those days the classical teacher had few
of the facilities that his modern colleague enjoys. It was, however,
a good preparation for Amyot’s peculiar mission, and he even found
time to make his first experiments in the sphere that was to be his
own. By 1546 he had completed a translation of the <i>Aethiopica</i>
of Heliodorus, the famous Greek romance that deals with the loves
and adventures of Theagenes and Chariclea. Amyot afterwards, on
the authority of a manuscript which he discovered in the Vatican,
identified the author with a Bishop of Tricca who lived in the end of
the fourth century, and of whom a late tradition asserted that when
commanded by the provincial synod either to burn his youthful effusion
or resign his bishopric, he chose the latter alternative. “Heliodorus,”
says Montaigne, when discussing parental love, “ayma mieulx perdre la
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
dignité, le proufit, la devotion d’une prelature si venerable, que
de perdre sa fille, fille qui dure encores bien gentille, mais à
l’aventure pourtant un peu curieusement et mollement goderonnee pour
fille ecclesiastique et sacerdotale, et de trop amoureuse
façon.”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
In the case of the young French professor it had happier and opposite
consequences, for it procured him from the king the Abbey of Bellozane.
This gift, one of the last that Francis bestowed for the encouragement
of letters, was partly earned, too, by a version of some of Plutarch’s
<i>Lives</i>, which Amyot presented to his royal patron and had
executed at his command.</p>

<p>With an income secured Amyot was now in a position to free himself from
the drudgery of class work, and follow his natural bent. In those days
not all the printed editions of the classics were very satisfactory,
and some works of the authors in whom he was most interested still
existed only in manuscript or were known only by name. He set out
for Italy in the hope of discovering the missing <i>Lives</i> of
Plutarch and of obtaining better texts than had hitherto been within
his reach, and seems to have remained abroad for some years. For a
moment he becomes a conspicuous figure in an uncongenial scene. In
May, 1551, the Council of Trent had been reopened, but Charles delayed
the transaction of business till the following September. The Italian
prelates, impatient and indignant, were hoping for French help against
the emperor, but instead of the French Bishops there came only a letter
from the “French King addressed to ‘the Convention’ which he would
not dignify with the name of a council. The King said he had not been
consulted about their meeting. He regarded them as a private synod got
up for their own purposes by the Pope and the Emperor and he would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
nothing to do with them.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
It was Amyot who was commissioned with the delivery and communication
of the ungracious message. Probably the selection of the simple
Abbé was intended less as an honour to him than as an insult to the
assemblage. At any rate it was no very important part that he had to
play, but it was one which made him very uncomfortable. He writes: “Je
filois le plus doux que je pouvois, me sentant si mal et assez pour me
faire mettre en prison, si j’eusse un peu trop avant parle.” He was
not even named in the letter, and had not so much as seen it before
he was called to read it aloud, so that he complains he never saw a
matter so badly managed, “si mal cousu,” but he delivered the contents
with emphasis and elocution. “Je croy qu’il n’y eust personne en toute
la compagnie qui en perdist un seul mot, s’il n’estoit bien sourd, de
sorte que si ma commission ne gisoit qu’a présenter les lettres du
roy, et à faire lecture de la proposition, je pense y avoir amplement
satisfait.”</p>

<p>But his real interests lay elsewhere, and he brought back from Italy
what would indemnify him for his troubles as envoy and please him more
than the honour of such a charge. In his researches he had made some
veritable finds, among them a new manuscript of Heliodorus, and Books
<span class="allsmcap">XI.</span> to <span class="allsmcap">XVII.</span>
of Diodorus Siculus’ <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>, only the two last of
which had hitherto been known at all. His treatment of this discovery is
characteristic,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> both of his
classical enthusiasm and his limitations as a classical scholar. He did
not, as the specialist of that and perhaps of any age would have done,
edit and publish the original text, but contented himself with giving
to the world a French translation. But the <i>Historic Library</i> has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
neither the allurement of a Greek romance nor the edification of
Plutarch’s <i>Lives</i>; and in this version, which for the rest is
said to be poor, Amyot for once appealed to the popular interest in vain.</p>

<p>The Diodorus Siculus appeared in 1554, and in the same year Henry
II. appointed Amyot preceptor to his two sons, the Dukes of Orleans
and Anjou, who afterwards became respectively Charles IX. and Henry
III. As his pupils were very young their tuition cannot have occupied
a great deal of his time, and he was able to pursue his activity as
translator. In 1559, besides a revised edition of <i>Theagenes and
Chariclea</i>, there appeared anonymously a rendering, probably made
at an earlier date, of the <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>, a romance even
more “curieusement et mollement goderonnee pour fille ecclesiastique
et sacerdotale” than its companion. But it is with his own name and a
dedication to the King that Amyot published almost at the same date
his greatest work, the complete translation of Plutarch’s <i>Parallel
Lives</i>. If his Heliodorus gave him his first step on the ladder
of church preferment, his Plutarch was a stronger claim to higher
promotion. Henry II., indeed, died before the end of the year, but the
accession of Amyot’s elder pupil in 1560, after the short intercalary
reign of Francis II., was propitious to his fortunes, for the new king,
besides bestowing on him other substantial favours, almost immediately
named him Grand Almoner of France.</p>

<p>Amyot was an indefatigable but deliberate worker. Fifteen years had
elapsed between his first appearance as translator and the issue of his
masterpiece. Thirteen more were to elapse before he had new material
ready for the press. The interval in both cases was filled up with
preparation, with learned labour, with the leisurely prosecution of his
plan. A revised edition of the <i>Lives</i> appeared in 1565 and a third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
in 1567, and all the time he was pushing on a version of Plutarch’s
<i>Moralia</i>. Meanwhile in 1570 Charles gave him the bishopric
of Auxerre; and without being required to disown the two literary
daughters of his vivacious prime, “somewhat curiously and voluptuously
frounced and of too amorous fashion” though they might be, he had
yet to devote himself rather more seriously to his profession than
he hitherto seems to have done. He set about it in his usual steady
circumspect way. He composed sermons, first, it is said, writing them
in Latin and then turning them into French; he attended faithfully to
the administration of his diocese; he applied himself to the study of
theological doctrine, and is said to have learned the <i>Summa</i> of
St. Thomas Aquinas by heart.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
These occupations have left their trace on his next work, which was
ready by 1572. Not only are Plutarch’s moral treatises perfectly
consonant in tone with Amyot’s episcopal office, but the preface is
touched with a breath of religious unction, of which his previous
performances show no trace. Perhaps the flavour is a little too
pronounced when in his grateful dedication to his royal master he
declares: “The Lord has lodged in you singular goodness of nature.” The
substantive needs all the help that can be wrung from the adjective,
when used of Charles IX. in the year of St. Bartholomew. But Amyot,
though the exhibiter of “Plutarch’s men,” was essentially a private
student, and was besides bound by ties of intimacy and obligation to
his former pupil, who had certainly done well by him. Nor was the
younger brother behindhand in his acknowledgments. Charles died before
two years were out (for Amyot had a way of dedicating books to kings
who deceased soon after), and was lamented by Amyot in a simple and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
heartfelt Latin elegy. But his regrets were quite disinterested,
for when Henry III. succeeded in 1574, he showed himself as kind a
master, and in 1578 decreed that the Grand Almoner should also be
Commander of the Order of the Holy Ghost without being required to give
proofs of nobility.</p>

<p>Invested with ample revenues and manifold dignities, Amyot for the
next eleven years lived a busy and simple life, varying the routine
of his administrative duties with music, of which he was a lover and
a practitioner; with translations, never published and now lost, from
the Greek tragedians, who had attracted him as professor, and from
St. Athanasius, who appealed to him as bishop; above all, with the
revision of his Plutarch, for which he never ceased to collect new
readings. Then came disasters, largely owing to his reputation for
partiality and complaisance. When the Duke and the Cardinal of Guise
were assassinated in 1589, he was accused by the Leaguers of having
approved the crime and of having granted absolution to the King. This
he denied; but his Chapter and diocesans rose against him, the populace
sacked his residence, and he had to fly from Auxerre. Nor were his
woes merely personal. On August 3rd the House of Valois, to which he
was so much beholden, became extinct with the murder of Henry III.;
and however worthless the victim may have been, Amyot cannot have been
unaffected by old associations of familiarity and gratitude. Six days
later he writes that he is “the most afflicted, desolate and destitute
poor priest I suppose, in France.” His private distress was not of long
duration. He made peace with the Leaguers, denounced the “politicians”
for supporting Henry IV., returned to his see, resumed his episcopal
duties, though he was divested of his Grand Almonership, and was able
to leave the large fortune of two hundred thousand crowns. But he did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
not survive to see the establishment of the new dynasty or the triumph
of Catholicism, for he died almost eighty years old in February, 1593,
and only in the following June was Henry IV. reconciled to the Church.
Perhaps had he foreseen this consummation Amyot would have found some
comfort in the thought that a third pupil, a truer and greater one than
those who were no more, would reign in their stead, and repair the
damage their vice and folly had caused. “Glory to God!” writes Henry of
Navarre to his wife, “you could have sent me no more pleasant message
than the news of the zest for reading which has taken you. Plutarch
always attracts me with a fresh novelty. To love him is to love me, for
he was for long the instructor of my early years. My good mother, to
whom I owe everything, and who had so great a desire to watch over my
right attitude and was wont to say that she did not wish to see in her
son a distinguished dunce, put this book in my hands when I was all but
an infant at the breast. It has been, as it were, my conscience, and
has prescribed in my ear many fair virtues and excellent maxims for my
behaviour and for the management of my affairs.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>Amyot has exerted a far-reaching influence on the literature of his own
country and of Europe. Though as a translator he might seem to have no
more than a secondary claim, French historians of letters have dwelt on
his work at a length and with a care that are usually conceded only to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
the achievements of creative imagination or intellectual discovery. And
the reason is that his aptitude for his task amounts to real genius,
which he has improved by assiduous research, so that in his treatment,
the ancillary craft, as it is usually considered, rises to the rank
of a free liberal art. He has the insight to divine what stimulus and
information the age requires; the knowledge to command the sources that
will supply them; the skill to manipulate his native idiom for the new
demands, and suit his expression, so far as may be, both to his subject
and to his audience. Among the great masters of translation he occupies
a foremost place.</p>

<p>Of spontaneous and initiative power he had but little. He cannot stand
alone. For Henry II. he wrote a <i>Projet de l’Eloquence Royal</i>,
but it was not printed till long after his death; and of this and
his other original prose his biographer, Roulliard, avows that the
style is strangely cumbersome and laggard (<i>estrangement pesant et
traisnassier</i>). Even in his prefaces to Plutarch he is only good
when he catches fire from his enthusiasm for his author. Just as his
misgivings at the Council of Trent, his commendations of his royal
patrons, his concessions to his enemies of the League, suggest a defect
in independent force of character, so the writings in which he must
rely on himself show a defect in independent force of intellect.</p>

<p>Nor is he a specialist in scholarship. Already in 1635, when he had
been less than a century in his grave, Bachet de Méziriac, expert in
all departments of learning, exposed his shortcomings in a Discourse
on Translation, which was delivered before the Academy. His critic
describes him as “a promising pupil in rhetoric with a mediocre
knowledge of Greek, and some slight tincture of Polite Letters”; and
asserts that there are more than two thousand passages in which he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
perverted the sense of his author. Even in 1580-81, during Amyot’s
lifetime, Montaigne was forced to admit in discussion with certain
learned men at Rome that he was less accurate than his admirers
had imagined. He was certainly as far as possible from being a
<i>Zunftgelehrter</i>. His peculiar attitude is exactly indicated by
his treatment of the missing books of Diodorus which it was his good
fortune to light upon. He is not specially interested in his discovery,
and has no thought of giving the original documents to the world. At
the same time he has such a reverence for antiquity that he must do
something about them. So with an eye to his chosen constituency, his
own countrymen, he executes his vernacular version.</p>

<p>For of his own countrymen he always thought first. They are his
audience, and he has their needs in his mind. And that is why he made
Plutarch the study of his life. His romances are mere experiments for
his pastime and equipment:<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
his Diodorus is a task prescribed by accident and vocation: but his
Plutarch is a labour of love and of patriotism. It was knowledge
of antiquity for which the age clamoured and of which it stood in
need; and who else could give such a summary and encyclopaedia
of Classical Life as the polyhistor of Chaeronea, who interested
himself in everything, from details of household management to the
government of states, from ancestral superstitions to the speculations
of philosophers, from after-dinner conversation to the direction of
campaigns; but brought them all into vital relation with human nature
and human conduct? Plutarch appealed to the popular instinct of the
time and to the popular instinct in Amyot’s own breast. It is his large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
applicability “distill’d through all the needful uses of our lives”
and “fit for any conference one can use” that, for example, arouses
the enthusiasm of Montaigne. After mentioning that when he writes he
willingly dispenses with the companionship or recollection of books,
he adds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">But it is with more difficulty that I can get
rid of Plutarch: he is so universal and so full that on all occasions
and whatever out-of-the-way subject you have taken up, he thrusts
himself into your business, and holds out to you a hand lavish and
inexhaustible in treasures and ornaments. I am vexed at his being so
much exposed to the plunder of those who resort to him. I can’t have
the slightest dealings with him myself, but I snatch a leg or a
wing.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">And again:</p>

<p class="blockquot">I am above all grateful to [Amyot] for having had
the insight to pick out and choose a book so worthy and so seasonable,
to make a present of it to his country. We dunces should have been
lost, if this book had not raised us out of the mire. Thanks to it
we now dare to speak and write. With it the ladies can lecture the
school-masters. It is our breviary.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">“In all kinds Plutarch is my man,” he says elsewhere. And
indeed it is obvious, even though he had not told us, that Plutarch with Seneca
supplies his favourite reading, to which he perpetually recurs. “I
have not,” he writes, “systematically acquainted myself with any solid
books except Plutarch and Seneca, from whom I draw like the Danaides,
filling and pouring out continually.”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
To the latter he could go for himself; for the Greek he had to depend on
Amyot. For combined profit and pleasure, he says, “the books that serve me are
Plutarch, <i>since he is French</i>, and Seneca.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
But it is to the former that he seems to give the palm.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Seneca is full of smart and witty sayings,
Plutarch of things: the former kindles you more and excites you, the
latter satisfies you more and requites you better; he guides us while
the other drives us.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>It is indeed impossible to imagine Montaigne without Plutarch, to whom
he has a striking resemblance both in his free-and-easy homilies and in
his pregnant touches. It is these things on which he dwells.</p>

<p class="blockquot">There are in Plutarch many dissertations at full
length well worth knowing, for in my opinion he is the master-craftsman
in that trade; but there are a thousand that he has merely indicated;
he only points out the track we are to take if we like, and confines
himself sometimes to touching the quick of a subject. We must drag
(the expositions) thence and put them in the market place.... It is a
dissertation in itself to see him select a trivial act in the life of a
man, or a word that does not seem to have such import.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>But Montaigne did not stand alone in his admiration. He himself, as we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
have seen, bears witness to the widespread popularity of Amyot’s
Plutarch and the general practice of rifling its treasures. Indeed,
Plutarch was seen to be so congenial to the age, that frequent
attempts had been made before Amyot to place him within the reach
of a larger circle than the little band of Greek scholars. In 1470,
<i>e.g.</i> a number of Italians had co-operated in a Latin version of
the <i>Lives</i>, published at Rome by Campani, and this was followed
by several partial translations in French.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
But the latter were immediately superseded, and even the former had its
authority shaken, by Amyot’s achievement.</p>

<p>This was due partly to its greater intelligence and faithfulness,
partly to its excellent style.</p>

<p>In regard to the first, it should be remembered that the criticism of
Amyot’s learning must be very carefully qualified. Scholarship is a
progressive science, and it is always easy for the successor to point
out errors in the precursor, as Méziriac did in Amyot. Of course,
however, the popular expositor was not a Budaeus or Scaliger, and the
savants whom Montaigne met in Rome were doubtless justified in their
strictures. Still the zeal that he showed and the trouble that he took
in searching for good texts, in conferring them with the printed books
and in consulting learned men about his conjectural emendations,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
would suggest that he had the root of the matter in him, and there is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
evidence that expert opinion in his own days was favourable to his
claims.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>At the time when he was translating the <i>Lives</i> into French
two scholars of high reputation were, independently of each other,
translating them into Latin. Xylander’s versions appeared in 1560,
those of Cruserius were ready in the same year, but were not published
till 1564. They still hold their place and enjoy consideration. Now,
they both make their compliments to Amyot. Xylander, indeed, has only
a second-hand acquaintance with his publication, but even that he has
found valuable:</p>

<p class="blockquot">After I had already finished the greater part of
the work, the <i>Lives of Plutarch</i> written by Amyot in the French
language made their appearance. And since I heard from those who are
skilled in that tongue, a privilege which I do not possess, that he
had devoted remarkable pains to the book and used many good MSS.,
assisted by the courtesy of friends, I corrected several passages
about which I was in doubt, and in not a few my conjecture was
established by the concurrence of that translator.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Cruserius, again, in his prefatory <i>Epistle to the Reader</i>, warmly
commends the merits of Xylander and Amyot, but refers with scarcely
veiled disparagement to the older Latin rendering, which nevertheless
enjoyed general acceptance as the number of editions proves, and was
considered the standard authority.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">If indeed (he writes) I must not here say that
I by myself have both more faithfully and more elegantly interpreted
<i>Plutarch’s Lives</i>, the translation of which into Latin a great
number of Italians formerly undertook without much success; this at
least I may say positively and justly that I think I have done
this.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand “Amiotus” has been a help to him. When he had
already polished and corrected his own version, he came across this
very tasteful rendering in Brussels six months after it had appeared.
“This man’s scholarship and industry gave me some light on several
passages.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
It is well then to bear in mind, when Amyot’s competency is
questioned, that by their own statement he cleared up things for
specialists like Xylander and Cruserius. And this is all the more
striking, that Cruserius, whom his preface shows to be very generous
in his acknowledgments, has no word of recognition for his Italian
predecessors even though Filelfo was among their number.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
But his Epistle proceeds: “To whom (<i>i.e.</i> to Amyot) I will give
this testimony that nowadays it is impossible that anyone should render
Plutarch so elegantly in the Latin tongue, as he renders him in his
own.”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
And this praise of Amyot’s style leads us to the next point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
If Amyot claims the thanks of Western Europe for giving it with
adequate faithfulness a typical miscellany of ancient life and thought,
his services to his country in developing the native language are
hardly less important. Before him Rabelais and Calvin were the only
writers of first-rate ability in modern French. But Rabelais’ prose
was too exuberant, heterogeneous and eccentric to supply a model;
and Calvin, besides being suspect on account of his theology, was of
necessity as a theologian abstract and restricted in his range. The new
candidate had something of the wealth and universal appeal of the one,
something of the correctness and purity of the other.</p>

<p>Since Plutarch deals with almost all departments of life, Amyot had
need of the amplest vocabulary, and a supply of the most diverse
locutions. Indeed, sometimes the copious resources of his vernacular,
with which he had doubtless begun to familiarise himself among the
simple folk of Melun, leave him in the lurch, and he has to make loans
from Latin or Greek. But he does this sparingly, and only when no other
course is open to him. Generally his thorough mastery of the dialect of
the Île de France, the standard language of the kingdom, helps him out.</p>

<p>Yet he is far from adopting the popular speech without consciously
manipulating it. He expressly states that he selects the fittest,
sweetest, and most euphonious words, and such as are in the mouths
of those who are accustomed to speak well. The ingenuousness of his
utterance, which is in great measure due to his position of pioneer
in a new period, should not mislead us into thinking him a careless
writer. His habit of first composing his sermons in Latin and then
translating them into French tells its own story. He evidently realised
the superiority in precision and orderly arrangement of the speech of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Rome, and felt it a benefit to submit to such discipline the artless
<i>bonhomie</i> of his mother tongue. But since he is the born
interpreter, whose very business it was to mediate between the exotic
and the indigenous, and assimilate the former to the latter, he never
forgets the claims of his fellow Frenchmen and his native French. He
does not force his idiom to imitate a foreign model, but only learns
to develop its own possibilities of greater clearness, exactitude, and
regularity.</p>

<p>It is for these excellencies among others, “pour la naifeté et purété
du language en quoi il surpasse touts aultres,”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
that Montaigne gives him the palm, and this purity served him in good
stead during the classical period of French literature, which was so
unjust to most writers of the sixteenth century, and found fault with
Montaigne himself for his “Gasconisms.” Racine thought that Amyot’s
“old style” had a grace which could not be equalled in our modern
language. Fénelon regretfully looks back to him for beauties that are
fallen into disuse. Nor was it only men of delicate and poetic genius
who appreciated his merits. Vaugelas, the somewhat illiberal grammarian
and purist, is the most enthusiastic of the worshippers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">What obligation (he exclaims) does our language
not owe to him, there never having been anyone who knew its genius and
character better than he, or who used words and phrases so genuinely
French without admixture of the provincial expressions which daily
corrupt the purity of the true French tongue. All stores and treasures
are in the works of this great man. And even to-day we have hardly any
noble and splendid modes of speech that he has not left us; and though
we have cut out a half of his words and phrases, we do not fail to find
in the other half almost all the riches of which we boast.</p>

<p>It will be seen, however, that in such tributes from the seventeenth
century (and the same thing is true of others left unquoted), it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
implied that Amyot is already somewhat antiquated and out of fashion.
He is honoured as ancestor in the right line of classical French, but
he is its ancestor and not a living representative. Vaugelas admits
that half his vocabulary is obsolete, Fénelon regrets his charms just
because their date is past, Racine wonders that such grace should have
been attained in what is not the modern language.</p>

<p>And this may remind us of the very important fact, that Amyot could not
on account of his position deliver a facsimile of the Greek. Plutarch
lived at the close of an epoch, he at the beginning. The one employed
a language full of reminiscences and past its prime; the other, a
language that was just reaching self-consciousness and that had the
future before it. Both in a way were artists, but Plutarch shows his
art in setting his stones already cut, while Amyot provides moulds for
the liquid metal. At their worst Plutarch’s style becomes mannered and
Amyot’s infantile. By no sleight of hand would it have been possible to
give in the French of the sixteenth century an exact reproduction of
the Greek of the second. Grey-haired antiquity had to learn the accents
of stammering childhood.</p>

<p>Sometimes Amyot hardly makes an attempt at literal fidelity. The style
of his original he describes as “plein, serré et philosophistorique.”
With him it retains the fulness, but the condensation, or rather what
a modern scholar describes as “the crowding of the sentence,”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
often gives place to periphrasis, and of the “philosophistorique” small trace
remains. Montaigne praises him because he has contrived “to expound so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
thorny and crabbed<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
an author with such fidelity.” What is most crabbed and thorny in
Plutarch he passes over or replaces with a loose equivalent; single
words he expands to phrases; difficulties he explains with a gloss or
illustration that he does not hesitate to insert in the text; and he
is anxious to bring out the sense by adding more emphatic and often
familiar touches.</p>

<p>The result of it all undoubtedly is to lend Plutarch a more popular
and less academic bearing than he really has. Some of Amyot’s most
attractive effects either do not exist or are inconspicuous in his
original. The tendency to artifice and rhetoric in the pupil of
Ammonius disappears, and he is apt to get the credit for an innocence
and freshness that are more characteristic of his translator. M. Faguet
justly points out that Amyot in his version makes Plutarch “a simple
writer, while he was elegant, fastidious, and even affected in his
style.” ... He “emerges from Amyot’s hands as <i>le bon Plutarque</i>
of the French people, whereas he was certainly not that.” Thus it
is beyond dispute that the impression produced is in some respects
misleading.</p>

<p>But there is another side to this. Plutarch in his tastes and ideals
did belong to an older, less sophisticated age, though he was born
out of due time and had to adapt his speech to his hyper-civilised
environment. Ampère has called attention to the picture, suggested
by the facts at our disposal, of Plutarch living in his little
Boeotian town, obtaining his initiation into the mysteries, punctually
fulfilling the functions of priest, making antiquities and traditions
his hobby. “There was this man under the rhetorician,” he adds, “and we
must not forget it. For if the rhetorician wrote, it was the other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Plutarch who often dictated.” Of course in a way the antithesis is
an unreal one. Plutarch was after all, as every one must be, the
child of his own generation, and his aspirations were not confined to
himself. The <i>Sophistes</i> is, on the one hand, what the man who
makes antiquity and traditions his hobby, is on the other. Still it
remains certain that his love was set on things which pertained to an
earlier and less elaborate phase of society, to “the good old days”
when they found spontaneous acceptance and expression. On him the ends
of the world are come, and he seeks by all the resources of his art and
learning to revive what he regards as its glorious prime. His heart is
with the men “of heart, head, hand,” but when he seeks to reveal them,
he must do so in the chequered light of a vari-coloured culture.</p>

<p>Hence there was a kind of discrepancy between his spirit and his
utterance; and Amyot, removing the discrepancy, brings them into a
natural harmony. There is truth in the paradox that the form which
the good bishop supplies is the one that was meant for the matter.
“Amyot,” says Demogeot, summing up his discussion of this aspect of the
question, “has in some sort created Plutarch, and made him truer and
more complete than nature made him.”</p>

<p>But though Plutarch’s ideas seem from one point of view to enter
into their predestined habitation, this does not alter the fact that
they lose something of their distinctive character in accommodating
themselves to their new surroundings. It is easy to exaggerate their
affinity with the vernacular words, as it is easy to exaggerate the
correspondence between author and translator. Thus Ampère, half in
jest, pleases himself with drawing on behalf of the two men a parallel
such as is appended to each particular brace of <i>Lives</i>. Both of
them lovers of virtue, he points out, for example, that both had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
veneration for the past, of which the one strove to preserve the
memories even then beginning to fade, and the other to rediscover and
gather up the shattered fragments. Both experienced sad and troublous
times without having their tranquillity disturbed, the one by the
crimes of Domitian or the other by the furies of St. Bartholomew’s.
Both belonged to the hierarchy, the one as priest of Apollo, the other
as Bishop of Auxerre.</p>

<p>But it is not hard to turn such parallels into so many contrasts. The
past with which Plutarch was busy was in a manner the familiar past
of his native country or at least of his own civilisation; but Amyot
loved the past of that remote and alien world in which for ages men had
neglected their heritage and taken small concern. The sequestered life
of the provincial under the Roman Empire, a privacy whence he emerges
to whatever civil offices were within his reach, is very different
from the dislike and refusal of public activity that characterises
the Frenchman in his own land at a time when learning was recognised
as passport to high position in the State. The priest of a heathen
cult which he could accept only when explained away by a rationalistic
idealism, and which was by no means incompatible with his family
instincts, was very different from the celibate churchman who ended by
submitting to the terms imposed by the intolerance of the Holy League.
The analogies are there, and imply perhaps a strain of intellectual
kinship, but the contrasts are not less obvious, and refute the idea of
a perfect unison.</p>

<p>Now, it is much the same if we turn from the writers to their writings.
All translation is a compromise between the foreign material and the
native intelligence, but in Amyot the latter factor counts most.
Classical life is very completely assimilated to the contemporary life
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
that he knew, but such contemporary life was in some ways quite
unlike that which he was reproducing. There is an illusory sameness
in the effects produced as there is an illusion of coincidence in
the characters and careers of the men who produce them, and this may
have its cause in real contact at certain points. But the gaps that
separate them are also real, though at the time they were seldom
detected. “Both by the details and the general tone of his version,”
says M. Lanson, “[Amyot] modernises the Graeco-Roman world, and by this
involuntary travesty he tends to check the awakening of the sense for
the differences, that is, the historic sense. As he invites Shakespeare
to recognise the English <i>Mob</i> in the <i>Plebs Romana</i>, so
he authorises Corneille and Racine and even Mademoiselle Scudéry to
portray under ancient names the human nature they saw in France.”</p>

<p>And this tendency was carried further in Amyot’s English translator.</p>

<h4 id="NORTH">3. NORTH</h4>

<p>Of Sir Thomas North, the most recent and direct of the authorities
who transmitted to Shakespeare his classical material, much less is
known than of either of his predecessors. Plutarch, partly because
as original author he has the opportunity of expressing his own
personality, partly because he uses this opportunity to the full in
frank advocacy of his views and gossip about himself, may be pictured
with fair vividness and in some detail. Such information fails in
regard to Amyot, since he was above all the mouthpiece for other men;
but his high dignities placed him in the gaze of contemporaries, and
his reputation as pioneer in classical translation and nursing-father
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of modern French ensured a certain interest in his career. But North,
like him a translator, had not equal prominence either from his
position or from his achievement. Such honours and appointments as he
obtained were not of the kind to attract regard. He was a mere unit in
the Elizabethan crowd of literary importers, and belonged to the lower
class who never steered their course “to the classic coast.” He had no
such share as Amyot in shaping the traditions of the language, but was
one writer in an age that produced many others, some of them greater
masters than he. Yet to us, as the immediate interpreter of Plutarch to
Shakespeare, he is the most important of the three, the most famous and
the most alive. Sainte Beuve, talking of Amyot, quotes a phrase from
Leopardi in reference to the Italians who have associated themselves
forever with the Classics they unveiled: “Oh, how fair a fate! to be
exempt from death except in company with an Immortal!” This fair fate
is North’s in double portion. He is linked with a great Immortal by
descent, and with a greater by ancestry.</p>

<p>Thomas North, second son of the first Baron North of Kirtling, was
born about 1535, to live his life, as it would seem, in straitened
circumstances and unassuming work. Yet we might have anticipated for
him a prosperous and eminent career. He had high connections and
powerful patrons; his father made provision for him, his brother helped
him once and again, a royal favourite interested himself on his behalf.
His ability and industry are evident from his works; his honesty and
courage are vouched for by those in a position to know; the efficiency
of his public services received recognition from his fellow-citizens
and his sovereign. But with all these advantages and qualifications he
was even in middle age hampered by lack of means, and he never had much
share in the pelf and pomp of life. Perhaps his occupation with larger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
concerns than personal aggrandisement may have interfered with his
material success. At any rate, in his narrower sphere he showed himself
a man of public interest and public spirit, and the authors with whom
he busies himself are all such as commend ideal rather than tangible
possessions as the real objects of desire. And we know besides that he
was an unaggressive man, inclined to claim less than his due; for in
one of his books he professes to get the material only from a French
translation, when it is proved that he must have had recourse to the
Spanish original as well.</p>

<p>This was his maiden effort, <i>The Diall of Princes</i>, published in
1557, when North was barely of age and had just been entered a student
of Lincoln’s Inn; and with this year the vague and scanty data for
his history really begin. He dedicates his book to Queen Mary, who
had shown favour to his father, pardoning him for his support of Lady
Jane Grey, raising him to the peerage, and distinguishing him in other
ways. But on the death of Mary, Lord North retained the goodwill of
Elizabeth, who twice kept her court at his mansion, and appointed him
Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely. The family had
thus considerable local influence, and it was not diminished when, on
the old man’s death in 1564, Roger, the first son, succeeded to the
title. Before long the new Lord North was made successively an alderman
of Cambridge, Lord Lieutenant of the County, and High Steward; while
Thomas, who had benefited under his father’s will, was presented to the
freedom of the town. All through, the career of the junior appears as a
sort of humble pendant to that of the senior, and he picks up his dole
of the largesses that Fortune showers on the head of the house. What he
had been doing in the intervening years we do not know, but he cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
have abandoned his literary pursuits, for in 1568, when he received
this civic courtesy, he issued a new edition of the <i>Diall</i>,
corrected and enlarged; and he followed it up in 1570 with a version of
Doni’s <i>Morale Filosofia</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the elder brother was advancing on his brilliant course. He
had been sent to Vienna to invest the Emperor Maximilian with the Order
of the Garter; he had been commissioned to present the Queen on his
return with the portrait of her suitor, the Archduke Charles; he had
held various offices at home, and in 1574 he was appointed Ambassador
Extraordinary to congratulate Henry III. of France on his accession,
and to procure if possible toleration for the Huguenots and a renewal
of the Treaty of Blois. On this important legation he was accompanied
by Thomas, who would thus have an opportunity of seeing or hearing
something of Amyot, the great Bishop and Grand Almoner who was soon to
be recipient of new honours from his royal pupil and patron, and who
had recently been drawing new attention on himself by his third edition
of the <i>Lives</i> and his first edition of the <i>Morals</i>.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
It may well be that this visit suggested to Thomas North his own
masterpiece, which he seems to have set about soon after he came home
in the end of November. At least it was to appear in January, 1579,
before another lustre was out; and a translation even from French
of the entire <i>Lives</i>, not only unabridged but augmented (for
biographies of Hannibal and Scipio are added from the versions of
Charles de l’Escluse),<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> is a task of years rather than of months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
The embassage, despite many difficulties to be overcome, had been a
success, and Lord North returned to receive the thanks and favours
he deserved. He stood high in the Queen’s regard, and in 1578 she
honoured him with a visit for a night. He was lavish in his welcome,
building, we are told, new kitchens for the occasion; filling them with
provisions of all kinds, the oysters alone amounting to one cart load
and two horse loads; rifling the cellars of their stores, seventy-four
hogsheads of beer being reinforced with corresponding supplies of
ale, claret, white wine, sack, and hippocras; presenting her at her
departure with a jewel worth £120 in the money of the time. In such
magnificent doings he was by no means unmindful of his brother, to whom
shortly before he had made over the lease of a house and household
stuff. Yet precisely at this date, when Thomas North was completing or
had completed his first edition of the <i>Lives</i>, his circumstances
seem to have been specially embarrassed. Soon after the book appeared
Leicester writes on his behalf to Burleigh, stating that he “is a very
honest gentleman and hath many good parts in him which are drowned only
by poverty.” There is perhaps a certain incongruity between these words
and the accounts of the profusion at Kirtling in the preceding year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lord North, to his reputation as diplomatist and courtier
sought to add that of a soldier. In the Low Countries he greatly
distinguished himself by his capacity and courage; but he was called
home to look after the defences of the eastern coast in view of the
expected Spanish invasion, and this was not the only time that the
Government resorted to him for military advice.</p>

<p>No such important charge was entrusted to Thomas, but he too was ready
to do his duty by his country in her hour of need, and in 1588 had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
command of three hundred men of Ely. In the interval between this and
the distressful time of 1579 his position must have improved; for
in 1591, in reward it may be for his patriotic activity, the Queen
conferred on him the honour of knighthood, which in those days implied
as necessary qualification the possession of land to the minimum value
of £40 a year. This was followed by other acknowledgments and dignities
of moderate worth. In 1592 and again in 1597 he sat on the Commission
of Peace for Cambridgeshire. In 1598 he received a grant of £20 from
the town of Cambridge, and in 1601 a pension of £40 a year from the
Queen. These amounts are not munificent, even if we take them at the
outside figure suggested as the equivalent in modern money.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
They give the impression that North was not very well off, that in his
circumstances some assistance was desirable, and a little assistance
would go a long way. At the same time they show that his conduct
deserved and obtained appreciation. Indeed, the pension from the Queen
is granted expressly “in consideration of the good and faithful service
done unto us.”</p>

<p>He also benefited by a substantial bequest from Lord North, who had
died in 1600, but he was now an old man of at least sixty-six, and
probably he did not live long to enjoy his new resources. Of the
brother Lloyd records: “There was none better to represent our State
than my Lord North, who had been two years in Walsingham’s house,
four in Leicester’s service, had seen six courts, twenty battles,
nine treaties, and four solemn jousts, whereof he was no mean part.”
In regard to the younger son, even the year of whose death we do not
know, the parallel summary would run: “He served a few months in an
ambassador’s suite; he commanded a local force, he was a knight, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
sat on the Commission of Peace; he made three translations, one of
which rendered possible Shakespeare’s Roman Plays.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>This is his “good and faithful service” unto us, not that he fulfilled
duties in which he might have been rivalled by any country justice or
militia captain. And, “a good and faithful servant,” he had qualified
himself for his grand performance by a long apprenticeship in the
craft. Like Amyot, he devotes himself to translation from first to
last, but unlike Amyot he knows from the outset the kind of book that
it is given him to interpret. He is not drawn by the fervour of youth
to “vain and amatorious romance,” nor by conventional considerations to
the bric-a-brac of antiquarianism. From the time that he has attained
the years of discretion and comes within our knowledge, he applies his
heart to study and supply works of solid instruction.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Souninge in moral vertu was his speche,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is characteristic, too, both of his equipment and his style, that
though he may have known a little Greek and certainly knew some Latin,
as is shown by a few trifling instances in which he gives Amyot’s
expressions a more learned turn, he never used an ancient writer
as his main authority, but confined himself to the adaptations and
translations that were current in modern vernaculars.</p>

<p>Thus his earliest work is the rendering, mainly from the French, of the
notable and curious forgery of the Spanish Bishop, Antonio de Guevara,
alleged by its author to have been derived from an ancient manuscript
which he had discovered in Florence. It was originally entitled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
<i>El Libro Aureo de Marco Aurelio, Emperador y eloquentissimo Orator</i>,
but afterwards, when issued in an expanded form, was rechristened,
<i>Marco Aurelio con el Relox de Principes</i>. It has however little
to do with the real Marcus Aurelius, and the famous <i>Meditations</i>
furnish only a small ingredient to the work. It is in some ways an
imitation of Xenophon’s <i>Cyropaedia</i>, that is, it is a didactic
romance which aims at giving in narrative form true principles of
education, morals, and politics. But the narrative is very slight, and
most of the book is made up of discussions, discourses, and epistles,
the substance of which is in many cases taken with a difference from
Plutarch’s <i>Moralia</i>. These give the author scope to endite “in
high style”; and in his balanced and erudite way of writing, which
with all its tastelessness and excess has a far-off resemblance to
Plutarch’s more rhetorical effects, as well as in his craze for
allusions and similes, he anticipates the mannerisms of the later
Euphuists. But despite the moralisings and affectations (or rather,
perhaps, on account of them, for the first fell in with the ethical
needs of the time, and the second with its attempts to organise its
prose), the book was a great favourite for over a hundred years, and
Casaubon says that except the Bible, hardly any other has been so
frequently translated or printed. Lord Berners had already made his
countrymen acquainted with it in shorter form, but North renders the
<i>Diall of Princes</i> in full, and even adds another treatise of
Guevara’s, <i>The Favored Courtier</i>, as fourth book to his second
edition.</p>

<p>It is both the contents and the form that attract him. In the title
page he describes it as “right necessarie and pleasaunt to all
gentylmen and others which are louers of vertue”; and in his preface he
says that it is “so full of high doctrine, so adourned with auncient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
histories, so authorised with grave sentences, and so beautified with
apte similitudes, that I knowe not whose eies in reding it can be
weried, nor whose eares in hearing it not satisfied.”</p>

<p>That North’s contemporaries agreed with him in liking such fare is
shown by the publication of the new edition eleven years after the
first, and even more strikingly by the publication of John Lily’s
imitation eleven years after the second. For Dr. Landmann has proved
beyond dispute that the paedagogic romance of <i>Euphues</i>, in
purpose, in plan, in its letters and disquisitions, its episodes and
persons, is largely based on the <i>Diall</i>. He has not been quite
so successful in tracing the distinctive tricks of the Euphuistic
style through North to Guevara. It has to be remembered that North’s
main authority was not the Spanish <i>Relox de Principes</i>, but
the French <i>Orloge des princes</i>; and at the double remove a
good many of the peculiarities of Guevarism were bound to become
obliterated: as in point of fact has occurred. It would be a mistake to
call North a Euphuistic writer, though in the <i>Diall</i>, and even
in the <i>Lives</i>, there are Euphuistic passages. Still, Guevara
did no doubt affect him, for Guevara’s was the only elaborate and
architectural prose with which he was on intimate terms. He had not the
advantage of Amyot’s daily commerce with the Classics, and constant
practice in the equating of Latin and French. In the circumstances a
dash of diluted Guevarism was not a bad thing for him, and at any rate
was the only substitute at his disposal. To the end he sometimes uses
it when he has to write in a more complex or heightened style.</p>

<p>But if the Spanish Bishop were not in all respects a salutary model,
North was soon to correct this influence by working under the guidance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
of a very different man, the graceless Italian miscellanist, Antonio
Francesco Doni. That copious and audacious conversationalist could
write as he talked, on all sorts of themes, including even those in
which there was no offence, and seldom failed to be entertaining. He is
never more so than in his <i>Morale Filosofia</i>, a delightful book
to which and to himself North did honour by his delightful rendering.
The descriptive title runs: “The Morall Philosophie of Doni: drawne out
of the auncient writers. A worke first compiled in the Indian tongue,
and afterwards reduced into diuers other languages: and now lastly
Englished out of Italian by Thomas North.” This formidable announcement
is a little misleading, for the book proves to be a collection of the
so-called Fables of Bidpai, and though the lessons are not lacking,
the main value as well as the main charm lies in the vigour and
picturesqueness of the little stories.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Thus in both his prentice works North betrays the same general bias.
They are both concerned with the practical and applied philosophy of
life, and both convey it through the medium of fiction: in so far they
are alike. But they are unlike, in so far as the relative interest of
the two factors is reversed, and the accent is shifted from the one to
the other. In the <i>Diall</i> the narrative is almost in abeyance,
and the pages are filled with long-drawn arguments and admonitions.
In the <i>Fables</i> the sententious purpose is rather implied than
obtruded, and in no way interferes with the piquant adventures; which
are recounted in a very easy and lively style.</p>

<p>North was thus a practised writer and translator, with a good knowledge
of the modern tongues, when he accompanied his brother to France in
1574. In his two previous attempts he had shown his bent towards
improving story and the manly wisdom of the elder world; and in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
second, had advanced in appreciation of the concrete example and the
racy presentment. If he now came across Amyot’s Plutarch, we can see
how well qualified he was for the task of giving it an English shape,
and how congenial the task would be. Of the <i>Moral Treatises</i>
he already knew something, if only in the adulterated concoctions of
Guevara, but the <i>Lives</i> would be quite new to him, and would
exactly tally with his tastes in their blend of ethical reflection and
impressive narrative. There is a hint of this double attraction in the
opening phrase of the title page: “The Lives of the Noble Grecians
and Romans compared by that grave learned <i>Philosopher</i> and
<i>Historiographer</i>, Plutarch of Chaeronea.” The philosophy and the
history are alike signalised as forming the equipment of the author,
and certainly the admixture was such as would appeal to the public as
well as to the translator.</p>

<p>The first edition of 1579, imprinted by Thomas Vautrouillier and John
Wight, was followed by a second in 1595, imprinted by Richard Field
for Bonham Norton. Field, who was a native of Stratford-on-Avon, and
had been apprenticed to Vautrouillier before setting up for himself,
had dealings with Shakespeare, and issued his <i>Venus and Adonis</i>
and <i>Rape of Lucrece</i>. But whether or no his fellow townsman put
him in the way of it, it is certain that Shakespeare was not long in
discovering the new treasure. It seems to leave traces in so early a
work as the <i>Midsummer-Night’s Dream</i>, which probably borrowed
from the life of <i>Theseus</i>, as well as in the <i>Merchant of
Venice</i>, with its reference to “Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia”;
though it did not inspire a complete play till <i>Julius Caesar</i>. In
1603 appeared the third edition of North’s Plutarch, enlarged with new
Lives which had been incorporated in Amyot’s collection in 1583: and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
this some think to have been the particular authority for <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> and <i>Coriolanus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
And again a fourth edition, with a separate supplement bearing the
date of 1610, was published in 1612; and of this the famous copy in
the Greenock Library has been claimed as the dramatist’s own book. If
by any chance this should be the case, then Shakespeare must have got
it for his private delectation, for by this time he had finished his
plays on ancient history and almost ceased to write for the stage. But
apart from that improbable and crowning honour, there is no doubt about
the value of North’s version to Shakespeare as dramatist, and the four
editions in Shakespeare’s lifetime sufficiently attest its popularity
with the general reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
This popularity is well deserved. Its permanent excellences were
sure of wide appreciation, and the less essential qualities that
fitted Plutarch to meet the needs of the hour in France, were not
less opportune in England. North’s prefatory “Address to the Reader”
describes not only his own attitude but that of his countrymen in general.</p>

<p class="blockquot">There is no prophane studye better than Plutarke.
All other learning is private, fitter for Universities then cities,
fuller of contemplacion than experience, more commendable in the
students them selves, than profitable unto others. Whereas stories,
(<i>i.e.</i> histories) are fit for every place, reache to all persons,
serve for all tymes, teache the living, revive the dead, so farre
excelling all other bookes as it is better to see learning in noble
mens lives than to reade it in Philosophers writings. Nowe, for the
Author, I will not denye but love may deceive me, for I must needes
love him with whome I have taken so much payne, but I bileve I might
be bold to affirme that he hath written the profitablest story of
all Authors. For all other were fayne to take their matter, as the
fortune of the contries where they wrote fell out; But this man, being
excellent in wit, in learning, and experience, hath chosen the speciall
actes, of the best persons, of the famosest nations of the world....
And so I wishe you all the profit of the booke.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This passage really sums up one half the secret
of Plutarch’s fascination for the Renaissance world. The aim is
profit, and profit not merely of a private kind. The profit is better
secured by history than by precept, just as the living example is more
effectual than the philosophic treatise. And there is more profit
in Plutarch than in any other historian, not only on account of his
personal qualifications, his wit, learning, and experience, but on
account of his subject-matter, because he had the opportunity and
insight to choose the prerogative instances in the annals of mankind.
Only it should be noted that the profit is conceived in the most
liberal and ideal sense. It is the profit that comes from contact with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
great souls in great surroundings, not the profit of the trite and
unmistakable moral. This Amyot had already clearly perceived and set
forth in a fine passage of which North gives a fine translation. The
dignity of the historian’s office is very high:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Forasmuch as his chiefe drift ought to be to serve
the common weale, and that he is but as a register to set downe the
judgements and definitive sentences of God’s Court, whereof some are
geven according to the ordinarie course and capacitie of our weake
naturall reason, and other some goe according to God’s infinite power
and incomprehensible wisedom, above and against all discourse of man’s
understanding.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In other words history is not profitable as
always illustrating a simple retributive justice. It may do that, but
it may also do otherwise. Some of its awards are mysterious or even
inscrutable. The profit it yields is disinterested and spiritual,
and does not lie in the encouragement of optimistic virtue. And this
indicates how it may be turned to account. The stuff it contains is the
true stuff for Tragedy.</p>

<p>The remaining half of Plutarch’s secret depends on the treatment, which
loses nothing in the hands of those who now must manage it; of whom the
one, in Montaigne’s phrase, showed “the constancy of so long a labour,”
and the other, in his own phrase, “took so much pain,” to adapt it
aright. But just as the charm of style, though undiminished, is changed
when it passes from Plutarch to Amyot, so too this takes place to
some degree when it passes from Amyot to North. North was translating
from a modern language, without the fear of the ancients before his
eyes. Amyot had translated from Greek, and was familiar with classical
models. Not merely does this affect the comparative fidelity of their
versions, as it was bound to do, for North, with two intervals between,
and without the instincts of an accurate scholar, could not keep so
close as even Amyot had done to the first original. Indeed he sometimes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
though not often, violates the meaning of the French, occasionally
misinterpreting a word, as when he translates Coriolanus’ final words
to his mother: “Je m’en revois (i.e. <i>revais</i>, <i>retourne</i>)
vaincu par toy seule,” by “I <i>see</i> myself vanquished by you
alone”; more frequently misconstruing an idiom, as when he goes wrong
with the negative in passages like the following: “Ces paroles feirent
incontinent penser à Eurybides et craindre que les Atheniens ne s’en
voulussent aller et les abandonner”; which he renders: “These wordes
made Eurybides presently thinke and feare that the Athenians would
<i>not</i> goe, and that they would forsake them.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>But the same circumstance affects North’s mode of utterance as well.
It is far from attaining to Amyot’s habitual clearness, coherence, and
correctness. His words are often clumsily placed, his constructions are
sometimes broken and more frequently charged with repetitions, he does
not always find his way out of a complicated sentence with his grammar
unscathed or his meaning unobscured. One of the few Frenchmen who take
exception to Amyot’s prose says that “it trails like the ivy creeping
at random, instead of flying like the arrow to its mark.” This is
unfair in regard to Amyot; it would be fairer, though still unfair, in
regard to North. Compare the French and English versions of the passage
that deals with Mark Antony’s “piscatory eclogue.” Nothing could be
more lucid or elegant than the French.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Il se meit quelquefois à pescher à la ligne, et
voyant qu’il ne pouvoit rien prendre, si en estoit fort despit et
marry à cause que Cléopatra estoit présente. Si commanda secrettement
à quelques pescheurs, quand il auroit jeté sa ligne, qu’ilz se
plongeassent soudain en l’eau, et qu’ilz allassent accrocher à son
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
hameçon quelques poissons de ceulx qu’ilz auroyent eu peschés
auparavent; et puis retira aussi deux or trois fois sa ligne avec
prise. Cleopatra s’en aperceut incontinent, toutes fois elle feit
semblant de n’en rien sçavoir, et de s’esmerveiller comme il peschoit
si bien; mais apart, elle compta le tout à ses familiers, et leur dit
que le lendemain ilz se trouvassent sur l’eau pour voir l’esbatement.
Ilz y vindrent sur le port en grand nombre, et se meirent dedans des
bateaux de pescheurs, et Antonius aussi lascha sa ligne, et lors
Cleopatra commanda à lun de ses serviteurs qu’il se hastast de plonger
devant ceulx d’Antonius, et qu’il allast attacher a l’hameçon de sa
ligne quelque vieux poisson sallé comme ceulx que lon apporte du païs
de Pont. Cela fait, Antonius qui cuida qu’il y eust un poisson pris,
tira incontinent sa ligne, et adonc comme lon peult penser, tous les
assistans se prirent bien fort à rire, et Cleopatra, en riant, lui dit:
“Laisse-nous, seigneur, à nous autres Ægyptiens, habitans<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
de Pharus et de Canobus, laisse-nous la ligne; ce n’est pas ton mestier.
Ta chasse est de prendre et conquerer villes et citez, païs et royaumes.” </p>

<p>The flow of the English is not so easy and transparent.</p>

<p class="blockquot">On a time he went to angle for fish, and when he
could take none, he was as angrie as could be, bicause Cleopatra stoode
by. Wherefore he secretly commaunded the fisher men, that when he cast
in his line, they should straight dive under the water, and put a
fishe on his hooke which they had taken before: and so snatched up his
angling rodde and brought up a fish twise or thrise. Cleopatra found it
straight, yet she seemed not to see it, but wondred at his excellent
fishing: but when she was alone by her self among her owne people, she
told them howe it was, and bad them the next morning to be on the water
to see the fishing. A number of people came to the haven, and got into
the fisher boates to see this fishing. Antonius then threw in his line,
and Cleopatra straight commaunded one of her men to dive under water
before Antonius men and to put some old salte fish upon his baite, like
unto those that are brought out of the contrie of Pont. When he had
hong the fish on his hooke, Antonius, thinking he had taken a fishe in
deede, snatched up his line presently. Then they all fell a-laughing.
Cleopatra laughing also, said unto him: “Leave us, (my lord), Ægyptians
(which dwell in the contry of Pharus and Canobus) your angling rodde:
this is not thy profession; thou must hunt after conquering realmes and
contries.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
This specimen is in so far a favourable one for North, that in
simple narrative he is little exposed to his besetting faults, but
even here the superior deftness of the Frenchman is obvious. We
leave out of account little mistranslations, like <i>on a time</i>
for <i>quelquefois</i>,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
or <i>the fishermen</i> for <i>quelques pescheurs</i>,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
or <i>alone by herself</i> for <i>apart</i>. We even pass over the lack
of connectedness when <i>they</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the persons informed)
<i>in great number</i><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
becomes the quite indefinite <i>a number of people</i>, and
the omission of the friendly nudge, so to speak, <i>as you can
imagine</i>, <i>comme lon peult penser</i>. But to miss the point of
the phrase <i>pour voir l’esbatement</i>, <i>to see the sport</i>,
and translate it <i>see the fishing</i>, and then clumsily insert
the same phrase immediately afterwards where it is not wanted and
does not occur; to change the order of the <i>fishe</i> and the
<i>hooke</i> and entangle the connection where it was quite clear, to
change <i>s’esmerveiller</i> to <i>wondred</i>, the infinitive to the
indicative past, and thus cloud the sense; to substitute the ambiguous
and prolix <i>When he had hong the fish on his hooke</i>, for the
concise and sufficient <i>cela fait</i>—to do all this and much more
of the same kind elsewhere was possible only because North was far
inferior to Amyot in literary tact. In the English version we have
often to interpret the words by the sense and not the sense by the
words; and this is a demand which is seldom made by the French.</p>

<p>But there are compensations. All modern languages have in their
analytic methods and common stock of ideas a certain family
resemblance, in which those of antiquity do not share; and in particular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
French is far closer akin to English than Greek to French. Since North
had specialised in the continental literature of his day and was
now dispensing the bounty of France, his allegiance to the national
idiom was virtually undisturbed, even when he made least change in
his original. He may be more licentious than Amyot in his treatment
of grammar, and less perspicuous in the ordering of his clauses, but
he is equal to him or superior in word music, after the English mode;
and he is even richer in full-blooded words and in phrases racy of the
soil. Not that he ever rejects the guidance of his master, but it leads
him to the high places and the secret places of his own language. So
while he is quick to detect the rhythm of the French and makes it his
pattern, he sometimes goes beyond it; though he can catch and reproduce
the cadences of the music-loving Amyot, it is sometimes on a sweeter
or a graver key. Take, for instance, that scene, the favourite with
Chateaubriand, where Philip, the freedman of Pompey, stands watching
by the headless body of his murdered master till the Egyptians are
sated with gazing on it, till they have “seen it their bellies full” in
North’s words. Amyot proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Puis l’ayant layé de l’eau de la mer, et enveloppé
d’une sienne pauvre chemise, pour ce qu’il n’avoit autre chose, il
chercha au long de la greve ou il trouva quelque demourant d’un vieil
bateau de pescheur, dont les pieces estoyent bien vieilles, mais
suffisantes pour brusler un pauvre corps nud, et encore non tout
entier. Ainsi comme il les amassoit et assembloit, il survint un Romain
homme d’aage, qui en ses jeunes ans avoit esté à la guerre soubs
Pompeius: si luy demanda: “Qui est tu, mon amy, qui fais cest apprest
pour les funerailles du grand Pompeius?” Philippus luy respondit qu’il
estoit un sien affranchy. “Ha,” dit le Romain, “tu n’auras pas tout
seul cest honneur, et te prie vueille moy recevoir pour compagnon
en une si saincte et si devote rencontre, à fin que je n’aye point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
occasion de me plaindre en tout et partout de m’estre habitué en païs
estranger, ayant en recompense de plusieurs maulx que j’y ay endurez,
rencontré au moins ceste bonne adventure de pouvoir toucher avec mes
mains, et aider a ensepvelir le plus grand Capitaine des Romains.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">This is very beautiful, but to English ears, at
least, there is something in North’s version, copy though it be, that
is at once more stately and more moving.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Then having washed his body with salt water, and
wrapped it up in an old shirt of his, because he had no other shift to
lay it in,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128"
class="fnanchor">[128]</a> he sought upon the sands and found at the
length a peece of an old fishers bote, enough to serve to burne his
naked bodie with, but not all fully out.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
As he was busie gathering the broken peeces of this bote together,
thither came unto him an old Romane, who in his youth had served under
Pompey, and sayd unto him: “O friend, what art thou that preparest the
funeralls of Pompey the Great.” Philip answered that he was a bondman
of his infranchised. “Well,” said he, “thou shalt not have all this
honor alone, I pray thee yet let me accompany thee in so devout a
deede, that I may not altogether repent me to have dwelt so long in a
straunge contrie where I have abidden such miserie and trouble; but
that to recompence me withall, I may have this good happe, with mine
owne hands to touche Pompey’s bodie, and to helpe to bury the only and
most famous Captaine of the Romanes.”<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, while anything but a purist in the diction he
employs, North’s foreign loans lose their foreign look, and become
merely the fitting ornament for his native homespun. It is chiefly on
the extraordinary wealth of his vocabulary, his inexhaustible supply
of expressions, vulgar and dignified, picturesque and penetrating,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
colloquial and literary, but all of them, as he uses them, of
indisputable Anglicity—it is chiefly on this that his excellence as
stylist is based, an excellence that makes his version of Plutarch by
far the most attractive that we possess. It is above all through these
resources and the use he makes of them that his book distinguishes
itself from the French; for North treats Amyot very much as Amyot
treats Plutarch; heightening and amplifying; inserting here an emphatic
epithet and there a homely proverb; now substituting a vivid for a
colourless term, now pursuing the idea into pleasant side tracks. Thus
Amyot describes the distress of the animals that were left behind when
the Athenians set out for Salamis, with his average faithfulness.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Et si y avoit ne sçay quoi de pitoyable qui
attendrissoit les cueurs, quand on voyoit les bestes domestiques et
privées, qui couroient ça et là avec hurlemens et signifiance de regret
après leurs maistres et ceulx qui les avoient nourries, ainsi comme
ilz s’embarquoient: entre lesquelles bestes on compte du chien de
Xantippus, père de Pericles, que ne pouvant supporter le regret d’estre
laissé de son maistre, il se jeta dedans la mer après luy, et nageant
au long de la galère où il estoit, passa jusques en l’isle de Salamine,
là où si tost qu’il fust arrivé, l’aleine luy faillit, et mourut
soudainement.</p>

<p class="no-indent">But this account stirs North’s sympathy, and he
puts in little touches that show his interest and compassion.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> There was besides, a certain pittie that made
mens harts to yerne, when they saw the <i>poore doggs, beasts and
cattell</i> ronne up and doune, <i>bleating, mowing, and
howling out aloude</i> after their masters in token of sorowe, whan
they did imbarke. Amongst them there goeth a <i>straunge</i> tale of
Xanthippus dogge, who was Pericles father; which, for sorowe his master
had left him behind him, dyd caste him self after into the sea, and
swimming still by the galley’s side wherein his master was, he held on
to the Ile of Salamina, where so sone as <i>this poor curre</i>
landed, his breath fayled him, and dyed instantly.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Similarly, when he recounts the story how the Gauls entered Rome, North
cannot restrain his reverence for Papirius or his delight in his blow,
or his indignation at its requital. Amyot had told of the Gaul:</p>

<p class="blockquot">qui prit la hardiesse de s’approcher de Marcus
Papyrius, et luy passa tout doulcement<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
la main par dessus sa barbe qui estoit longue. Papyrius luy donna de
son baston si grand coup sur la teste, qu’il la luy blecea; dequoy le
barbare estant irrité, desguaina son espée, et l’occit.</p>

<p class="no-indent">North is not content with such reserve.</p>

<p class="blockquot">One of them went boldely unto M. Papyrius and
layed his hand fayer and softely upon his long beard. But Papyrius gave
him such a <i>rappe on his pate</i> with his staffe, that the <i>bloude
ran about his eares</i>. This <i>barbarous beaste</i> was in <i>such a
rage with the blowe</i> that he drue out his sworde and slewe
him.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">Or sometimes the picture suggested is so pleasant
to North that he partly recomposes it and adds some gracious touch to
enhance its charm. Thus he found this vignette of the peaceful period
that followed Numa:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Les peuples hantoient et trafiquoient les uns
avec les autres sans crainte ni danger, et s’entrevisitoient en toute
cordiale hospitalité, comme si la sapience de Numa eut été une vive
source de toutes bonnes et honnestes choses, de laquelle plusieurs
fleuves se fussent derivés pour arroser toute l’Italie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This is how North recasts and embellishes the last
sentence:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The people did trafficke and frequent together,
without feare or daunger, and visited one another, making great cheere:
<i>as if out of the springing fountain of Numa’s wisdom many
pretie brookes and streames of good and honest life had ronne
over all Italie and had watered it</i>.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">But illustrations might be multiplied through pages.
 Enough have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
given to show North’s debts to the French and their limits. With
a few unimportant errors, his rendering is in general wonderfully
faithful and close, so that he copies even the sequence of thought
and modulation of rhythm. He sometimes falls short of his authority
in simplicity, neatness, and precision of structure. On the other
hand he sometimes excels it in animation and force, in volume and
inwardness. But, and this is the last word on his style, even when he
follows Amyot’s French most scrupulously, he always contrives to write
in his own and his native idiom. And hence it came that he once for
all naturalised Plutarch among us. His was the epoch-making deed. His
successors, who were never his supersessors, merely entered into his
labours and adapted Plutarch to the requirements of the Restoration, or
of the eighteenth or of the nineteenth century. But they were adapting
an author whom North had made a national classic.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Plutarch was a Greek, to be sure, and a Greek
no doubt he is still. But as when we think of a Devereux ... we call
him an Englishman and not a Norman, so who among the reading public
troubles himself to reflect that Plutarch wrote Attic prose of such
and such a quality? Scholars know all about it to be sure, as they
know that the turkeys of our farm-yards come originally from Mexico.
Plutarch however is not a scholar’s author, but is popular everywhere
as if he were a native.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>But one aspect of this is that North carries further the process which
Amyot had begun of accommodating antiquity to current conceptions.
The atmosphere of North’s diction is so genuinely national that
objects discerned through it take on its hue. Under his strenuous
welcome the noble Grecian and Roman immigrants from France are forced
to make themselves at home, but in learning the ways of the English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
market-place they forget something of the Agora and the Forum. Perhaps
this was inevitable, since they were come to stay.</p>

<p>And the consequence of North’s method is that he meets Shakespeare
half way. His copy may blur some of the lines in the original picture,
but they are lines that Shakespeare would not have perceived. He may
present Antiquity in disguise, but it was in this disguise alone
that Shakespeare was able to recognise it. He has in short supplied
Shakespeare with the only Plutarch that Shakespeare could understand.
The highest compliment we can pay his style is, that it had a special
relish for Shakespeare, who retained many of North’s expressions with
little or no alteration. The highest compliment we can pay the contents
is, that, only a little more modernised, they furnished Shakespeare
with his whole conception of antique history.</p>

<p>The influence of North’s Plutarch on Shakespeare is thus of a two-fold
kind. There is the influence of the diction, there is the influence of
the subject-matter; and in the first instance it is more specifically
the influence of North, while in the second it is more specifically the
influence of Plutarch.</p>

<p>It would be as absurd as unfair to deny Shakespeare’s indebtedness
to North not only in individual turns and phrases, but in continuous
discourse. Often the borrower does little more than change the prose to
poetry. But at the lowest he always does that; and there is perhaps in
some quarters a tendency to minimise the marvel of the feat, and so, if
not to exaggerate the obligation, at least to set it in a false light.
He has nowhere followed North so closely through so many lines as in
Volumnia’s great speech to her son before Rome; and, next to that, in
Coriolanus’ great speech to Aufidius in Antium. In these passages the
ideas, the arrangement of the ideas, the presentation of the ideas are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
practically the same in the translator and in the dramatist: yet,
with a few almost imperceptible touches, a few changes in the order
of construction, a few substitutions in the wording, the language
of North, without losing any directness or force, gains a majestic
volume and vibration that are only possible in the cadences of the
most perfect verse. These are the cases in which Shakespeare shows
most verbal dependence on his author, but his originality asserts
itself even in them. North’s admirable appeal is not Shakespeare’s,
Shakespeare’s more admirable appeal is not North’s.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Similarly there has been a tendency to overestimate the loans of the
Roman Plays from Plutarch. From this danger even Archbishop Trench has
not altogether escaped in an eloquent and well-known passage which in
many ways comes very near to the truth. After dwelling on the freedom
with which Shakespeare generally treats his sources, for instance the
novels of Bandello or Cinthio, deriving from them at most a hint or
two, cutting and carving, rejecting or expanding their statements at
will, he concludes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">But his relations with Plutarch are very
different—different enough to justify or almost to justify the words of
Jean Paul when in his <i>Titan</i> he calls Plutarch “der biographische
Shakespeare der Weltgeschichte.” What a testimony we have here to the
true artistic sense and skill which, with all his occasional childish
simplicity<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
the old biographer possesses, in the fact that the mightiest and
completest artist of all times, should be content to resign himself
into his hands and simply to follow where the other leads.</p>

<p>To this it might be answered in the first place that Shakespeare
shows the same sort of fidelity in kind, though not in degree, to the
comparatively inartistic chronicles of his mother country. That is, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
is in part, as we have seen, his tribute not to the historical author
but to the historical subject. Granting, however, the superior claims
of Plutarch, it is yet an overstatement to say that Shakespeare is
content to resign himself into his hands, and simply to follow where
the other leads. Delius, after an elaborate comparison of biography and
drama, sums up his results in the protest that “Shakespeare has much
less to thank Plutarch for than one is generally inclined to suppose.”</p>

<p>Indeed, however much Plutarch would appeal to Shakespeare in virtue
both of his subjects and his methods, it is easy to see that even as
a “grave learned philosopher and historiographer” he is on the hither
side of perfection. He interrupts the story with moral disquisitions,
and is a little apt to preach, and often, through such intrusions and
irrelevancies, or the adherence of the commonplace, his most impressive
touches fail of their utmost possible effect: at least he does not
always seem aware of the full value of his details, of their depth
and suggestiveness when they are set aright. Yet he is more excellent
in details than in the whole: he has little arrangement or artistic
construction; he is not free from contradictions and discrepancies; he
gives the bricks and mortar but not the building, and occasionally some
of the bricks are flawed or the mortar is forgotten. And his stories
have this inorganic character, because he is seldom concerned to pierce
to the meaning that would give them unity and coherence. He moralises,
and only too sententiously, whenever an opportunity offers; but of the
principles that underlie the conflicts and catastrophes which in his
free-and-easy way he describes, he has at best but fragmentary glimpses.</p>

<p>And in all this the difference between the genial moralist and the
inspired tragedian is a vast one—so vast that when once we perceive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
it, it is hard to retain a fitting sense of the points of contact. In
Shakespeare, Plutarch’s weaknesses disappear, or rather are replaced
by excellences of precisely the opposite kind. He rejects all that
is otiose or discordant in speech or situation, and adds from other
passages in his author or from his own imagination, the circumstances
that are needed to bring out its full poetic significance. He always
looks to the whole, removes discrepancies, establishes the inner
connection; and at his touch the loose parts take their places as
members of one living organism. And in a sense, “he knows what it is
all about.” In a sense he is more of a philosophic historian than
his teacher. At any rate, while Plutarch takes his responsibilities
lightly in regard both to facts and conclusions, Shakespeare, in so
far as that was possible for an Elizabethan, has a sort of intuition
of the principles that Plutarch’s narrative involves; and while adding
some pigment from his own thought and feeling to give them colour and
visible shape, accepts them as his presuppositions which interpret the
story and which it interprets.</p>

<p>Thus the influences of North’s Plutarch, whether of North’s style or
of Plutarch’s matter, though no doubt very great, are in the last
resort more in the way of suggestion than of control. But they do not
invariably act with equal potency or in the same proportion. Thus
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> adheres most closely to the narrative of
the biographer, which is altered mainly by the omission of details
unsuitable for the purpose of the dramatist; but the words, phrases,
constructions, are for the most part conspicuously Shakespeare’s
own. Here there is a maximum of Plutarch and a minimum of North. In
<i>Coriolanus</i>, on the other hand, apart from the unconscious
modifications that we have noticed, Shakespeare allows himself more
liberty than elsewhere in chopping and changing the substance; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
lengthy passages and some of the most impressive ones are incorporated
in the drama without further alteration than is implied in the
transfiguration of prose to verse. Here there is the maximum of North
with the minimum of Plutarch. <i>Julius Caesar</i>, as in the matter
of the inevitable and unintentional misunderstandings, so again
here, occupies a middle place. Many phrases, and not a few decisive
suggestions for the most important speeches, have passed from the
<i>Lives</i> into the play: one sentence at least it is hard to
interpret without reference to the context; but here as a rule, even
when he borrows most, Shakespeare treats his loans very independently.
So, too, though he seldom wittingly departs from Plutarch, he
elaborates the new material throughout, amplifying and abridging,
selecting and rejecting, taking to pieces and recombining, not from one
Life but from three. Here we have the mean influence both of Plutarch
and of North.</p>

<p>In so far therefore <i>Julius Caesar</i> gives the norm of
Shakespeare’s procedure; and with it, for this as well as on
chronological grounds, we begin.</p>

<p>Although <i>Julius Caesar</i> was first published in the Folio of 1623,
seven years after Shakespeare’s death, there is not much doubt about
its approximate date of composition, which is now placed by almost all
scholars near the beginning of the seventeenth century. Some of the
evidence for this is partly external in character.</p>

<p>(1) In a miscellany of poems on the death of Elizabeth, printed in
1603, and entitled <i>Sorrowes Joy</i>, the lines occur:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They say a <i>comet</i> woonteth to appeare</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
Another apparent loan belongs to the same year. In 1603 Drayton rewrote
his poem of <i>Mortimeriados</i> under the title of <i>The Barons’
Wars</i>, altering and adding many passages. One of the insertions runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Such one he was, of him we boldely say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In whose riche soule all soueraigne powres did sute,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2"><i>So mixt</i> as none could soueraignty impute;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As all did gouerne, yet all did obey.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">His liuely temper was so absolute,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That ’t seemde when heauen his modell first began,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In him it <i>shewd perfection in a man</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Compare Antony’s verdict on Brutus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His life was gentle, and <i>the elements</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>So mix’d</i> in him, that Nature might stand up</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> v. 73.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Some critics have endeavoured to minimise this
coincidence on the ground that it was a common idea that man was
compounded of the four elements. But that would not account for such
close identity of phrase. There must be some connection; and that
Drayton, not Shakespeare, was the copyist, is rendered probable by the
circumstance that Drayton, in 1619, <i>i.e.</i> after Shakespeare’s
death, makes a still closer approach to Shakespeare’s language.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(2) Apart, however, from these apparent adaptations in 1603, there
is reason to conjecture that the play had been performed by May in the
previous year. At that date, as we know from Henslowe’s <i>Diary</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
Drayton, Webster and others were engaged on a tragedy on the same
subject called <i>Caesar’s Fall</i>. Now it is a well ascertained fact
that when a drama was a success at one theatre, something on a similar
theme commonly followed at another. The entry therefore, that in the
early summer of 1602 Henslowe had several playwrights working at this
material, apparently in a hurry, since so many are sharing in the
task, is in so far presumptive evidence that Shakespeare’s <i>Julius
Caesar</i> had been produced in the same year or shortly before.</p>

<p>(3) But these things are chiefly important as confirming the
probability of another allusion, which would throw the date a little
further back still. In Weever’s <i>Mirror of Martyrs</i> there is the
quatrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The many headed multitude were drawne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Brutus speech, that Caesar was ambitious,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When eloquent Mark Antony had showne</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His vertues, who but Brutus then was vicious.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now this has a much more specific reference to the famous scene in
the Play than to anything in Plutarch, who, for instance, even in the
<i>Life of Brutus</i>, which gives the fullest account of Brutus’
dealings with the citizens, does not mention the substance of his
argument and still less any insistence on Caesar’s ambition, but only
says that he “made an oration unto them to winne the favor of the
people, and to justifie what they had done”; and this passage, which
contains the fullest notice of Brutus’ speeches, like the corresponding
one in the <i>Life of Caesar</i>, attributes only moderate success
to his appeal in the market place, while it goes on to describe the
popular disapproval as exploding before the intervention of Antony.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span><a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Thus it seems fairly certain that a knowledge of Shakespeare’s play is
presupposed by the <i>Mirror of Martyrs</i>, which was printed in 1601.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it cannot have been much earlier. The absence of
such a typical “tragedy” from Meres’ list in 1598 is nearly proof
positive that it was not then in existence.</p>

<p>After that the <i>data</i> are less definite. <i>A Warning for Fair
Women</i>, printed in 1599, contains the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">I have given him fifteen wounds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which will be fifteen <i>mouths</i> that do accuse me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In every mouth there is a bloody <i>tongue</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which will <i>speak</i>, although he holds his peace.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is difficult not to bring these into connection
with Antony’s words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Over thy wounds now do I prophesy——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which like dumb <i>mouths</i> do ope their ruby lips</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To beg the voice and utterance of my <i>tongue</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 259.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I tell you that which you yourselves do know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor, poor dumb <i>mouths</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bid them <i>speak</i> for me: but were I Brutus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would ruffle up your spirits and put a <i>tongue</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In every <i>wound</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent38">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 228.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But in this Shakespeare may have been the debtor
not the creditor: and other coincidences like the “Et tu, Brute,” in
<i>Acolastus his Afterwit</i><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
(1600) may be due to the use of common or current
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
authorities. One little detail has been used as an argument that the
play was later than 1600. Cassius says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As easily as a king.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 159·)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here obviously the word we should have expected is
<i>infernal</i> not <i>eternal</i>. It has been conjectured<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
that the milder expression was substituted in deference to the
increasing disapproval of profane language on the stage; and since
three plays published in 1600 use <i>infernal</i>, the inference is
that <i>Julius Caesar</i> is subsequent to them. One fails to see,
however, why Shakespeare should admit the substantive and be squeamish
about the adjective: in point of fact, much uglier words than either
find free entry into his later plays. And one has likewise to remember
that the <i>Julius Caesar</i> we possess was published only in 1623,
and that such a change might very well have been made in any of the
intervening years, even though it were written before 1600. The most
then that can be established by this set of inferences, is that it was
produced after Meres’ <i>Palladis Tamia</i> in 1598 and before Weever’s
<i>Mirror of Martyrs</i> in 1601.</p>

<p>The narrowness of the range is fairly satisfactory, and it may be
further reduced. It has been surmised that perhaps Essex’ treason
turned Shakespeare’s thoughts to the story of another conspiracy by
another high-minded man, and that Caesar’s reproach, “Et tu, Brute,”
derived not from the Parallel Lives but from floating literary
tradition, would suggest to an audience of those days the feeling of
Elizabeth in regard to one whom Shakespeare had but recently celebrated
as “the general of our gracious Empress.” At any rate the time seems
suitable. Among Shakespeare’s serious plays <i>Julius Caesar</i> most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
resembles in style <i>Henry V.</i>, written between March and September
1599, as the above allusion to Essex’ expedition shows,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
and <i>Hamlet</i>, entered at Stationers’ Hall in 1602, as “latelie acted.”
But the connection is a good deal closer with the latter than with
the former, and extends to the parallelism and contrast between the
chief persons, both of them philosophic students called upon to make a
decision for which their temperament and powers do not fit them, and
therefore the one of them deciding wrong and the other hardly deciding
at all. Both pieces contain references to the story of Caesar, but
those in <i>Hamlet</i> accord better with the tone of the tragedy. Thus
the chorus says of Henry’s triumph:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like to the senators of the antique Rome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the plebeians swarming at their heels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go forth to fetch their conquering Caesar in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> prologue 25.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Would this passage have been penned if Shakespeare
had already described how the acclamations of the plebs were
interrupted by the tribunes, and how among the senators there were some
eager to make away with the Victor?</p>

<p>But the two chief references in <i>Hamlet</i> merely abridge what is
told more at large in the Play. Polonius says: “I did enact Julius
Caesar: I was killed i’ the Capitol. Brutus killed me” (III. ii. 108),
which is only a bald summary of the central situation. Hamlet says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 113.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
This reads like a condensed anthology from the descriptions of Casca,
Cassius and Calpurnia, eked out with a few hints from another passage
in Plutarch that had not hitherto been utilised.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>Even the quatrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O, that that earth which kept the world in awe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should patch a wall to expel the winter’s flaw!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 236.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">is in some sort the ironical development of
Antony’s thought:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shrunk to this little measure?</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 148.)</div>
 </div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But yesterday the word of Caesar might</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have stood against the world: now lies he there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And none so poor to do him reverence.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 123.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Owing to Weever’s reference we cannot put <i>Julius Caesar</i> after
<i>Hamlet</i>, but it seems to have closer relations with <i>Hamlet</i>
than with <i>Henry V.</i> It is not rash to place it between the two,
in 1600 or 1601. This does not however mean that we necessarily have it
quite in its original form. On the contrary, there are indications that
it may have been revised some time after the date of composition.</p>

<p>Thus Ben Jonson in his <i>Discoveries</i> writes of Shakespeare: “His
wit was in his own power: would the rule of it had been so too! Many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
times he fell into those things could not escape laughter, as when he
said in the person of Caesar, one speaking to him, ‘Caesar, thou dost
me wrong,’ he replied, ‘Caesar did never wrong but with just cause,’
and such like; which were ridiculous.” Most people would see in this
a very ordinary example of the figure called Paradox, and some would
explain <i>wrong</i> in such a way that even the paradox disappears:
but the alleged <i>bêtise</i> tickled Ben’s fancy, for he recurs to it
to make a point in the Introduction to the <i>Staple of News</i>. One
of the persons says: “I can do that too, if I have cause”; to which the
reply is made: “Cry you mercy; you never did wrong but with just cause.”</p>

<p>Now in the present play there is no such expression. The nearest
analogue occurs in the conclusion of the speech, in which Caesar
refuses the petition for Publius Cimber’s recall,</p>

<p class="no-indent">It has been suggested<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
that Jonson simply misquoted the passage. But it is not likely that
Ben would consciously or unconsciously pervert the authentic text by
introducing an absurdity, still less by introducing an absurdity that
few people find absurd. In his criticisms on Shakespeare he does not
manufacture the things to which he objects, but regards them from an
unsympathetic point of view. It seems probable, therefore, that he has
preserved an original reading, that was altered out of deference for
strictures like his: and this in so far supports the theory that the
play was corrected after its first appearance.</p>

<p>So, too, with the versification. The consideration of certain
technicalities, such as the weak ending, would place <i>Julius
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Caesar</i> comparatively early, but there are others that yield a more
ambiguous result. It may have been revived and revised about 1607 when
the subject was again popular.</p>

<p>And perhaps it has survived only in an acting edition. It is
unusually short: and, that Shakespeare’s plays were probably abridged
for the stage, we know from comparison of the Quarto with the
Folio <i>Hamlets</i>. The same argument has been used in regard to
<i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>Still granting the plausibility up to a certain point of this
conjecture, its importance must not be exaggerated. It does not
affect the fact that <i>Julius Caesar</i> belongs essentially to the
very beginning of the century, and that it is an organic whole as it
stands. If abridged, it is still full, compact and unattenuated. If
revised, its style, metre and treatment are still all characteristic
of Shakespeare’s early prime. The easy flow of the verse, the luminous
and pregnant diction, the skilful presentation of the story in a few
suggestive incidents, all point to a time when Shakespeare had attained
complete mastery of his methods and material, and before he was driven
by his daemon to tasks insuperable by another and almost insuperable by him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Reaching that heaven might so replenish him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above and through his art.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is perhaps another aspect of the perfect and harmonious beauty,
which fulfils the whole play and every part of it, that while there is
none of the speeches “that is in the bad sense declamatory, none that
does not gain by its context nor can be spared from it without some
loss to the dramatic situation,” there are many “which are eminently
adapted for declamation”;<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
that is, for delivery by themselves. In the later plays, on the other hand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
it is far more difficult to extract any particular jewel from its setting.</p>

<p>It is pretty certain then that <i>Julius Caesar</i> is the first
not only of the Roman Plays, but of the great series of Tragedies.
The flame-tipped welter of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, the poignant
radiance of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> belong to Shakespeare’s pupilage
and youth. Their place is apart from each other and the rest in the
vestibule and forecourt of his art. The nearest approach to real
Tragedy he had otherwise made was in the English History of <i>Richard
III.</i> And now when that period of his career begins in which he is
chiefly occupied with the treatment of tragic themes, it is again to
historical material that he has recourse, and he chooses from it the
episode which was probably of supreme interest to the Europe of his
day. Since Muretus first showed the way, the fate of Caesar had again
and again been dramatised in Latin and in the vernacular, in French
and in English. It was a subject that to a genius of the second rank
might have seemed hackneyed, but a genius of the highest rank knows
that the common is not hackneyed but catholic, and contains richer
possibilities than the recondite. Shakespeare had already been drawn to
it himself. The frequent references in his earlier dramas show how he
too was fascinated by the glamour of Caesar. In the plays adapted by
him, he inserts or retains tributes to Caesar’s greatness, to the irony
or injustice of his fate. Bedford in his enthusiasm for the spirit of
Henry V., as ordained to prosper the realm and thwart adverse planets,
can prefer him to only one rival,</p>

titular hero. But Shakespeare keeps recurring to the theme almost to
the end. When in <i>Measure for Measure</i> the disreputable Pompey is
conveyed to prison, it suggests a ridiculous parallel with that final
triumph of Caesar’s when the tribunes saw far other</p>

<p>The subject then was one of widespread interest and had an abiding
fascination for Shakespeare himself. After leaving national history
in <i>Henry V.</i> he seems to have turned to the history of Rome for
the first Tragedy of his prime in a spirit much like that in which he
had gone to the English Chronicles. And he goes to it much in the same
way. It has been said that in most of the earlier series “Holinshed
is hardly ever out of the poet’s hands.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Substituting Plutarch for Holinshed the expression is true in this case
too. An occasional phrase like the <i>Et tu, Brute</i>, he obtained
elsewhere, most probably from familiar literary usage, but conceivably
from the lost Latin play of Dr. Eedes or Geddes. Stray hints he may
have derived from other authorities; for instance, though this is not
certain, a suggestion or two from Appian’s <i>Civil Wars</i> for Mark
Antony’s Oration.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
It is even possible that he may have been directed to the conception
and treatment of a few longer passages by his general reading: thus,
as we have seen, it has been maintained not without plausibility that
the first conversation between Brutus and Cassius can be traced to the
corresponding scene in the <i>Cornélie</i>.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
But in Plutarch he found practically all the stuff and substance for
his play, except what was contributed by his own genius; and any other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
ingredients are nearly imperceptible and altogether negligible.
Plutarch, however, has given much. All the persons except Lucius come
from him, and Shakespeare owes to him a number of their characteristics
down to the minutest traits. Cassius’ leanness and Antony’s sleekness,
Brutus’ fondness for his books and cultivation of an artificial style,
Caesar’s liability to the falling sickness and vein of arrogance in his
later years, are all touches that are taken over from the Biographer.
So too with the events and circumstances, and in the main, the sequence
in which they are presented. Plutarch tells of the disapproval with
which the triumph over Pompey’s sons was regarded; of the prophecy
of danger on the Ides of March; of the offer of the crown on the
Lupercal; of the punishment of the Tribunes; of Cassius’ conference
with Brutus; of the anonymous solicitations that are sent to the
latter; of the respect in which he was held; of his relations with his
wife, and her demand to share his confidence; of the enthusiasm of the
conspirators, their contempt for an oath, their rejection of Cicero as
confederate, their exemption of Antony at Brutus’ request; of Ligarius’
disregard of his illness; of the prodigies and portents that preceded
Caesar’s death; of Calpurnia’s dream, her efforts to stay her husband
at home and the counter arguments of Decius Brutus; of Artemidorus’
intervention, the second meeting with the soothsayer; of Portia’s
paroxysm of anxiety; of all the details of the assassination scene;
of the speeches to the people by Brutus and Antony; of the effects of
Caesar’s funeral; of the murder of the poet Cinna; of the proscription
of the Triumvirate; of the disagreement of Brutus and Cassius on other
matters and with reference to Pella, and the interruption of the
intruder; of the apparition of the spirit, and the death of Portia;
of Brutus’ discussion with Cassius on suicide; of his imprudence at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Philippi; of the double issue and repetition of the battle; of the
death of Cassius and Brutus on their own swords; of the surrender of
Lucilius; of Antony’s eulogy of Brutus. There is thus hardly a link in
the action that was not forged on Plutarch’s anvil.</p>

<p>And even the words of North have in many cases been almost literally
transcribed. Says Lucilius when brought before Antony:</p>

<p class="blockquot">I dare assure thee, that no enemie hath taken, nor
shall take Marcus Brutus alive; and I beseech God keepe him from that
fortune. For wheresoever he be found, alive or dead; he will be found
like him selfe.</p>
<p class="author">(<i>Brutus.</i>)</p>

<p class="no-indent">Compare:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Or take the passage—considering its length, the
exactest reproduction of all—in which Portia claims full share in her
husband’s secrets. The sentiment is what we are accustomed to regard
as modern; but Plutarch, who himself viewed marriage as a relation in
which there was no Mine nor Thine,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
has painted the situation with heartfelt sympathy. After describing the
wound she gives herself to make trial of her firmness, he proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Then perceiving her husband was marvelously out of
quiet, and that he coulde take no rest: even in her greatest payne of
all, she spake in this sorte unto him: “I being, O Brutus (sayed she),
the daughter of Cato, was maried unto thee, not to be thy bedde fellowe
and companion at bedde and at borde onelie, like a harlot; but to be
partaker also with thee, of thy good and evill fortune. Nowe for thy
selfe, I can finde no cause of faulte in thee as touchinge our matche:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
but for my parte, howe may I showe my duetie towardes thee, and howe
muche I woulde doe for thy sake, if I cannot constantlie beare a secret
mischaunce or griefe with thee, which requireth secrecy and fidelity?
I confesse, that a woman’s wit commonly is too weake to keepe a secret
safely: but yet, Brutus, good educacion, and the companie of vertuous
men, have some power to reforme the defect of nature. And for my selfe,
I have this benefit moreover: that I am the daughter of Cato, and wife
of Brutus. This notwithstanding, I did not trust to any of these things
before; untill that now I have found by experience, that no paine nor
griefe whatsoever can overcome me.’ With those wordes she shewed him
her wounde on her thigh, and told him what she had done to prove her
selfe. Brutus was amazed to heare what she sayd unto him, and lifting
up his handes to heaven, he besought the goddes to give him grace he
might bring his enterprise to so good passe, that he might be founde a
husband, worthie of so noble a wife as Porcia.”</p>

Here we have “the marriage of true souls”; and though the prelude to
this nuptial hymn, a prelude that heralds and enhances its sweetness,
is veriest Shakespeare, when the main theme begins and the climax is
reached, he is content to resign himself to the ancient melody, and
re-echo, even while he varies, the notes.</p>

<p>North’s actual slips or blunders are received into the play. Thus the
account of the assassination runs: “Caesar was driven ... against
the base whereupon Pompey’s image stood, which ranne all of a goare
blood.” The last clause, probably by accident, adds picturesqueness to
Amyot’s simple description, “qui en fust toute ensanglantee,” and is
immortalised in Antony’s bravura:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Even at the base of Pompey’s statua</div>

    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 192.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">More noticeable is the instance of Brutus’ reply to
Cassius’ question, what he will do if he lose the battle at Philippi.
Amyot’s translation is straightforward enough.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Brutus luy respondit: “Estant encore jeune et non
assez experimenté es affaires de ce monde, je feis ne sçay comment un
discours de philosophie, par lequel je reprenois et blasmois fort Caton
d’estre desfait soymesme” etc.</p>

<p class="no-indent">That is:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Brutus answered him: “When I was yet young and not
much experienced in the affairs of this world, I composed, somehow or
other, a philosophic discourse in which I greatly rebuked and censured
Cato for having made away with himself!”</p>

<p>North did not notice where the quotation began; connected
<i>feis</i> with <i>fier</i> in place of <i>faire</i>, probably
taking it as present not as past; and interpreted <i>discours</i> as
<i>principle</i>, which it never meant and never can mean, instead of
<i>dissertation</i>. So he translates:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Brutus answered him, <i>being yet but a young man, and not
over-greatly experienced in the world</i>: I <i>trust</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
(I know not how) a certaine rule of Philosophie, by the which I did
greatly blame and reprove Cato for killing of him selfe; as being
no godly or lawful acte, touching the goddes; nor concerning men,
valliant; not to give place and yeld to divine providence, and not
constantly and paciently to take whatsoever it pleaseth him to send

that this battell fall out fortunate for us: I will looke no more for

<p>It is possible that North used <i>trust</i> in the first sentence as
a preterite equal to <i>trusted</i>, just as he uses <i>lift</i> for
<i>lifted</i>. But Shakespeare at least took it for a present: so he
was struck by the contradiction which the passage seems to contain.
He got over it, and produced a new effect and one very true to human
nature, by making Brutus’ latter sentiment the sudden response of his
heart, in defiance of his philosophy, to Cassius’ anticipation of what
they must expect if defeated.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This last illustration may show us, however, that
Shakespeare, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
when he seems to copy most literally, always introduces something that
comes from himself. Despite his wholesale appropriation of territory
that does not in the first instance belong to him, the produce is
emphatically his own. It is like the white man’s occupation of America
and Australasia, and can be justified only on similar grounds. The
lands remain the same under their new as under their old masters, but
they yield undreamed-of wealth to satisfy the needs of man. Never did
any one borrow more, yet borrow less, than Shakespeare. He finds the
clay ready to his hand, but he shapes it and breathes into it the
breath of life, and it becomes a living soul.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">SHAKESPEARE’S TRANSMUTATION OF HIS MATERIAL</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The examples given in the previous chapter may serve to show that
from one point of view it is impossible to exaggerate Shakespeare’s
dependence on Plutarch. But this is not the only or the most important
aspect of the case. He alters and adds quite as much as he gets. No
slight modification of the story is implied by its mere reduction
to dramatic shape, at least when the dramatiser is so consummate a
playwright as Shakespeare. And it is very interesting to observe the
instinctive skill with which he throws narrated episodes, like that of
the death of Cassius, into the form of dialogues and scenes. But the
dramatisation involves a great deal more than this. Shakespeare has to
fix on what he regards as the critical points in the continuous story,
to rearrange round them what else he considers of grand importance, and
to bridge in some way the gaps between. These were prime essentials
in all his English historical pieces. The pregnant moments have to be
selected; and become so many ganglia, in which a number of filaments
chronologically distinct are gathered up; yet they have to be exhibited
not in isolation, but as connected with each other, and all belonging
to one system. And in <i>Julius Caesar</i> this is the more noticeable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
as it makes use of more sources than one. The main authority is the
<i>Life of Brutus</i>, but the <i>Life of Caesar</i> also is employed
very freely, and the <i>Life of Antony</i> to some extent. The scope
and need for insight in this portion of the task are therefore
proportionately great.</p>

<p>Thus the opening scene refers to Caesar’s defeat of the sons of
Pompey in Spain, for which he celebrated his triumph in October,
45 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> But Shakespeare dates it on the 15th February, 44
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, at the Lupercalian Festival.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Then, in the account of Caesar’s chagrin at his reception, he mixes up,
as Plutarch himself to some extent does, two quite distinct episodes,
one of which does not belong to the Lupercalia at all.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
Lastly, it was only later that the Tribunes were silenced and deprived
of their offices for stripping the images, not of Caesar’s “trophies,”
but of “diadems,”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
or, more specifically, of the “laurel crown”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Antony had offered him.</p>

<p>The next group of events is clustered round the assassination, and
they begin on the eve of the Ides, the 14th March. But at first we are
not allowed to feel that a month has passed. By various artifices the
flight of time is kept from obtruding itself. The position of the scene
with the storm, which ushers in this part of the story, as the last of
the first act instead of the first of the second, of itself associates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
it in our minds with what has gone before. Then there are several
little hints that we involuntarily expand in the same sense. Thus
Cassius has just said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">I will this night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In several hands, in at his windows throw,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if they came from several citizens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Writings all tending to the great opinion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Caesar’s ambition shall be glanced at.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 319.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And now we hear him say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Good Cinna, take this paper,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where Brutus may but find it: and throw this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In at his window; set this up with wax</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon old Brutus’ statue.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 142.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">We seem to see him carrying out the programme that
he has announced for the night of the Lupercalia. Yet there are other
hints,—the frequency with which Brutus has received these instigations
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i. 49), his protracted uncertainty
since Cassius first sounded him (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i. 61),
the fact that he himself has had time to approach Ligarius,—which
presently make us realise that the opening scenes of the drama are left
a long way behind.</p>

<p>And in this section, too, Shakespeare has crowded his incidents. The
decisive arrangements of the conspirators, with their rejection of the
oath, are dated the night before the assassination; Plutarch puts them
earlier. Then, according to Plutarch, there was a senate meeting the
morning after Caesar’s murder; and Antony, having escaped in slave’s
apparel, proposed an amnesty for the perpetrators, offered his son as
hostage, and persuaded them to leave the Capitol. On the following day
dignities were distributed among the ringleaders and a public funeral
was decreed to Caesar. Only then did the reading of the will, the
speech of Antony, and the <i>émeute</i> of the people follow, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
reading of the will preceded the speech. After a while Octavius comes
from Apollonia to see about his inheritance.</p>

<p>In the play, on the other hand, Antony’s seeming agreement with
the assassins is patched up a few minutes after the assassination.
Octavius, summoned by the dead Caesar, is already within seven leagues
of Rome. Antony at once proceeds with the corpse to the market place.
He has hardly made his speech and then read the will, when, as the
citizens rush off in fury, he learns that Octavius has arrived.</p>

<p>A lengthy interval elapses between the end of Act <span class="smcap">iii.</span>
and the beginning of Act <span class="smcap">iv.</span>, occupied, so
far as Rome and Italy were concerned, with the rivalry and intrigues
of Antony and Octavius, and the discomfiture of the former (partly
through Cicero’s exertions), till he wins the army of Lepidus and
Octavius finds it expedient to join forces with him and establish the
Triumvirate. But of all this not a word in Shakespeare. He dismisses it
as irrelevant, and creates an illusion of speed and continuity, where
there is none. The servant who announces the arrival of Octavius, tells
Antony:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.</div>
    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xi. 269.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">“Bring me to Octavius,” says Antony. And the
fourth act opens “at a house in Rome,” “Antony, Octavius and Lepidus
seated at a table,” just finishing the lists of the proscription. The
impression produced is that their conference is direct sequel to the
popular outbreak and the conspirators’ flight. Yet it is November,
43 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and nineteen or twenty months have
gone by since the Ides of March. And the progress of time is indicated
as well as concealed. Antony announces as a new and alarming piece of
news</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">And now, Octavius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Listen great things:—Brutus and Cassius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are levying powers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 40.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
This too covers a gap in the history and hurries on the connection.
The suggestion is that they are beginning operations at last, and that
hitherto they have been inactive. Their various intermediate adventures
and wanderings are passed over. We are carried forward to their grand
effort, and are reintroduced to them only when they meet again at
Sardis in the beginning of 42 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, just before
the final movement to Philippi, where the battle was fought in October of
the same year.</p>

<p>And this scene also is “compounded of many simples.” The dispute which
the poet<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
interrupts, the difference of opinion about Pella, the appearance of
the Spirit, are all located at Sardis by Plutarch, but he separates
them from each other; the news of Portia’s death is undated, the
quarrel about money matters took place at Smyrna, and other traits are
derived from various quarters. Here they are all made</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To join like likes, and kiss like native things.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then at Philippi itself, not only are some of the speeches transferred
from the eve to the day of the engagement; but a whole series of
operations, and two pitched battles, twenty days apart, after the first
of which Cassius, and after the second of which Brutus, committed
suicide, are pressed into a few hours.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that though the action is spread over a period
of three years, from the triumphal entry of Caesar in October, 45
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, till the victory of his avengers in October,
<span class="smcap">42 b.c.</span>, Shakespeare concentrates it into the story
of five eventful days, which however do not correspond to the five separate acts, but
by “overlapping” and other contrivances produce the effect of close
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
sequence, while in point of fact, historically, they are not
consecutive at all.</p>

<p>In the first day there is the exposition, enforcing the predominance
of Caesar and the revulsion against it (Act <span class="allsmcap">i.</span>
i. and ii.); assigned to the 15th February, 44 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>In the second day there is the assassination with its immediate
preliminaries and sequels (Act <span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iii., Act
<span class="smcap">ii.</span>, Act <span class="smcap">iii.</span>)
all compressed within the twenty-four hours allowed to a French
tragedy, viz. within the interval between the night before the Ides of
March and the next afternoon or evening.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>In the third day there is the account of the Proscription in November,
43 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (Act <span class="smcap">iv.</span> i.). In the fourth day the meeting
of Brutus and Cassius, which took place early in 42 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and
the apparition of the boding spirit, are described (Act <span class="smcap">iv.</span>
ii. and iii.). Both these days are included in one act.</p>

<p>The fifth day is devoted to the final battle and its accessories, and
must be placed in October, 42 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
(Act <span class="allsmcap">v.</span>).</p>

<p>But the selection, assortment and filiation of the <i>data</i> are not
more conspicuous in the construction of the plot than in the execution
of the details. There will be frequent occasion to touch incidentally
on these and similar processes in the discussion of other matters, but
here it may be well to illustrate them separately, so far as that is
possible when nearly every particular instance shows the influence of
more than one of them.</p>

<p>Thus while Shakespeare’s picture of the very perfect union of Brutus
and Portia is taken almost in its entirety from Plutarch, who was
himself so keenly alive to the beauty of such a wedlock, the charm of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
the traits he adopts is heightened by the absence of those he rejects.
Probably indeed he did not know, for Plutarch does not mention it, that
Brutus had been married before, and had got rid of his first wife by
the simple and regular expedient of sending her home to her father.
But he did know that Portia, too, had a first husband, Bibulus, “by
whom she had also a young sonne.” The ideal beauty of their relation is
unbrushed by any hint of their previous alliances.</p>

<p>So, too, he attributes the coolness between Brutus and Cassius at the
beginning of the story merely to Brutus’ inward conflicts, and to
Cassius’ misconstruction of his preoccupation. In point of fact, it
had a more definite and less creditable cause. According to Plutarch,
they had both been strenuous rivals for the position of City Praetor,
Brutus recommended by his “vertue and good name,” Cassius by his “many
noble exploytes” against the Parthians. Caesar, saying “Cassius cause
is juster, but Brutus must be first preferred,” had given Brutus the
chief dignity and Cassius the second: therefore “they grew straunge
together for the sute they had for the praetorshippe.” But it would
not answer Shakespeare’s purpose to show Brutus as moved by personal
ambitions, or either of them as aspiring for honours that Caesar could
grant.</p>

<p>There are few better examples of the way in which Shakespeare
rearranges his material than the employment he makes of Plutarch’s
enumeration of the portents that preceded the assassination. It is
given as immediate preface to the catastrophe of the Ides.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Certainly, destenie may easier be foreseene then
avoyded; considering the straunge and wonderfull signes that were
sayd to be seene before Caesars death. For touching the fires in the
element, and spirites running up and downe in the night, and also these
solitarie birdes to be seene at noone dayes sittinge in the great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
market place: are not all these signes perhappes worth the noting in
such a wonderfull chaunce as happened? But Strabo the Philosopher
wryteth, that divers men were seene going up and downe in fire: and
furthermore, that there was a slave of the souldiers, that did cast a
marvelous burning flame out of his hande, insomuch as they that saw
it, thought he had been burnt, but when the fire was out, it was found
he had no hurt. Caesar selfe also doing sacrifice unto the Goddes,
found that one of the beastes which was sacrificed had no hart: and
that was a straunge thing in nature, how a beast could live without
a hart. Furthermore, there was a certain soothsayer that had geven
Caesar warning long time affore, to take heede of the day of the Ides
of Marche (which is the fifteenth of the moneth), for on that day he
should be in great daunger. That day being come, Caesar going into the
Senate house, and speaking merily to the Soothsayer, tolde him, ‘The
Ides of Marche be come’: ‘So be they’, softly aunswered the Soothsayer,
‘but yet are they not past.’ And the very day before, Caesar supping
with Marcus Lepidus, sealed certaine letters as he was wont to do at
the bord: so talke falling out amongest them, reasoning what death was
best: he preventing their opinions, cried out alowde, ‘Death unlooked
for.’ Then going to bedde the same night as his manner was, and lying
with his wife Calpurnia, all the windowes and dores of his chamber
flying open, the noyse awooke him, and made him affrayed when he saw
such light: but more when he heard his wife Calpurnia, being fast a
sleepe weepe and sigh, and put forth many fumbling and lamentable
speaches. For she dreamed that Caesar was slaine, and that she had
him in her armes.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to note how Shakespeare takes this passage to pieces
and assigns those of them for which he has a place to their fitting
and effective position. Plutarch’s reflections on destiny and Caesar’s
opinions on death he leaves aside. The first warning of the soothsayer
he refers back to the Lupercalia, and the second he shifts forward to
its natural place. Calpurnia’s outcries in her sleep and her prophetic
dream, the apparition of the ghosts mentioned by her among the other
prodigies, the lack of the heart in the sacrificial beast, are reserved
for the scene of her expostulation with Caesar, and are dramatically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
distributed between the various speakers, Caesar, the servant,
Calpurnia herself. Shakespeare relies on the fiery heavens and the
fire-girt shapes, the flaming hand and the boding bird for his grand
effect, and puts them in a setting where they gain unspeakably in
supernatural awe. Of course Shakespeare individualises Plutarch’s hints
and adds new touches. But the main terror is due to something else. We
are made to view these portents in the reflex light of Casca’s panic.
He has just witnessed them, or believes that he has done so, and now
breathless, staring, his naked sword in his hand, the storm raging
around, he gasps out his amazement at Cicero’s composure:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
Here the superstitious thrill rises to a paroxysm of dread; but the
effect of dispersing the subsidiary presages through so many scenes is
to steep the whole play in an atmosphere of weird presentiment, till
Caesar passes up to the very doors of the Capitol.</p>

<p>But besides selecting and rearranging the separate details, Shakespeare
establishes an inner connection between them even when in Plutarch they
are quite isolated from each other. This is well exemplified by the
manner in which the biography and the drama treat the circumstance that
the conspirators were not sworn to secrecy. Plutarch says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The onlie name and great calling of Brutus did bring on the most of
them to geve consent to this conspiracie. Who having never taken othes
together, nor taken or geven any caution or assurance, nor binding them
selves one to an other by any religious othes, they all kept the matter
so secret to them selves, and could so cunninglie handle it, that
notwithstanding the goddes did reveal it by manifeste signes and tokens
from above, and by predictions of sacrifices, yet all this would not be
believed.</p>

<p class="author">(<i>Marcus Brutus.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The drama puts it thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> Give me your hands all over, one by one.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cassius.</i> And let us swear our resolution.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> No, not an oath: if not the face of men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The suffrance of our souls, the time’s abuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If these be motives weak, break off betimes:</div>
    <div class="verse indent33">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 112.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and so on through the rest of his magnificent
speech that breathes the pure spirit of virtue and conviction. The
nobility of Brutus that is reverenced by all, the conspiracy of Romans
that is safe-guarded by no vows, move Plutarch’s admiration, but he
does not associate them. Shakespeare traces the one to the other and
views them as cause and effect.</p>

<p>Shakespeare thus greatly alters the character of Plutarch’s narrative
by his ceaseless activity in sifting it, ordering it afresh, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
reading into it an internal nexus that was often lacking in his
authority. But this last proceeding implies that he also makes
additions, and these are not only numerous and manifold, but frequently
quite explicit and very far-reaching. It is important to note that
Plutarch has furnished nothing more than stray hints, and often
not even so much, for all the longer passages that have impressed
themselves on the popular imagination. Cassius’ description of the
swimming match and of Caesar’s fever, Brutus’ soliloquy, his speech
on the oath, his oration and that of Mark Antony, even, when regarded
closely, his dispute with Cassius, are all virtually the inventions
of Shakespeare. The only exception is the conversation with Portia,
and even in it, though the climax, as we have seen, closely reproduces
both Plutarch’s matter and North’s expression, the fine introduction is
altogether Shakespearian.</p>

<p>But it is not the purple patches alone of which this is true. The more
carefully one examines the finished fabric, the more clearly one sees
that the dramatist has not merely woven and fashioned and embroidered
it, but has provided most of the stuff.</p>

<p>Sometimes the new matter is a possible or plausible inference from the
premises he found in his author.</p>

<p>Thus Plutarch represents the populace as on the whole favourable to
Caesar, but the tribunes as antagonistic. He also records, concerning
the celebration of Caesar’s victory over Pompey’s sons in Spain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The triumph he made into Rome for the same did as much offend the
Romanes, and more, then anything he had ever done before; bicause he
had not overcome Captaines that were straungers, nor barbarous kinges,
but had destroyed the sonnes of the noblest man in Rome, whom fortune
had overthrowen. And bicause he had plucked up his race by the rootes
men did not thinke it meete for him to triumphe so for the calamaties
of his contrie.</p>

<p class="author">(<i>Julius Caesar.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
This is all, but it is enough to give the foundation for the opening
scene, which otherwise, both in dialogue and declamation, is an
entirely free creation.</p>

<p>Sometimes again Shakespeare has realised the situation so vividly
that he puts in some trait from the occurrences as in spirit he has
witnessed them, something of the kind that may very well have happened,
though there is no trace of it in the records. Thus he well knows
what an unreasonable monster a street mob can be, how cruel in its
gambols, how savage in its fun. So in the account of the poet Cinna’s
end, though the gist of the incident, the mistake in identity, the
disregard of the explanation, are all given in Plutarch, Shakespeare’s
rioters wrest their victim’s innocent avowal of celibacy to a flout at
marriage, and meet his unanswerable defence, “I am Cinna the poet,”
with the equally unanswerable retort, “Tear him for his bad verses.”
(<span class="smcap">iii.</span> iii. 23.)</p>

<p>Some of these new touches do more than lend reality to the scene.
Though not incompatible with Plutarch’s account, they give it a turn
that he might disclaim and certainly does not warrant, but that
belongs to Shakespeare’s conception of the case. Thus after describing
the “holy course” of the Lupercal, and the superstition connected
with it, Plutarch mentions that Caesar sat in state to witness the
sport, and that Antony was one of the runners. There is nothing more;
and Calpurnia is not even named. Shakespeare’s introduction of her
is therefore very curious. Whatever else it means, it shows that
he imagined Caesar as desirous, certainly, of having an heir, and,
inferentially, of founding a dynasty.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the dramatist’s insertions directly contradict
the text of the <i>Lives</i>, if a more striking or more significant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
effect is to be attained, and if no essential fact is falsified. Thus
Plutarch tells of Ligarius:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Brutus] went to see him being sicke in his
bedde, and sayed unto him: “O Ligarius, in what a time art thou sicke!”
Ligarius risinge uppe in his bedde and taking him by the right hande,
sayed unto him: “Brutus,” sayed he, “if thou hast any great enterprise
in hande worthie of thy selfe, I am whole.”</p>

<p class="author">(<i>Marcus Brutus.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare, keeping the phrases quoted almost literally, emphasises
the effort that Ligarius makes, emphasises too the magnetic influence
of Brutus, by representing the sick man as coming to his friend’s
house, as well as by amplifying his words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Lucius.</i> Here is a sick man that would speak with you....</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Ligarius.</i> I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Any exploit worthy the name of honour....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By all the gods that Romans bow before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brave son, derived from honourable loins!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I will strive with things impossible;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, get the better of them....</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">... With a heart new-fired I follow you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To do I know not what: but it sufficeth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Brutus leads me on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 310.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>So too Plutarch describes the collapse of Portia in her suspense as
more complete than does the play, and makes Brutus hear of it just
after the critical moment when the conspirators fear that Lena has
discovered their plot:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Nowe in the meane time, there came one of Brutus
men post hast unto him, and tolde him his wife was a dying.... When
Brutus heard these newes, it grieved him, as is to be presupposed: yet
he left not of the care of his contrie and common wealth, neither went
home to his house for any newes he heard.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare not only is this very effective dramatic touch omitted,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
but Portia sends Brutus an encouraging message. As her weakness
increases upon her, she collects herself for a final effort and manages
to give the command:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Say, I am merry</i>: come to me again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bring me word what he doth say to thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iv. 44.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Shakespeare may perhaps have been unwilling to introduce anything into
the assassination scene that might distract attention from the decisive
business on hand, but the alteration is chiefly due to another cause.
These, the last words we hear Portia utter, were no doubt intended to
bring out her forgetfulness of herself and her thought of Brutus even
in the climax of her physical distress.</p>

<p>This, of course, does not affect our general estimate of Portia; but
Shakespeare has no scruple about creating an entirely new character
for a minor personage, and, in the process, disregarding the hints
that he found and asserting quite the reverse. Thus Plutarch has not
much to say about Casca, so Shakespeare feels free to sketch him after
his own fancy as rude, blunt, uncultured, with so little education
that, when Cicero speaks Greek, it is Greek to him. This is a libel on
his up-bringing. Plutarch in one of the few details he spares to him,
mentions that, when he stabbed Caesar, “they both cried out, Caesar in
Latin, ‘O vile traitor, Casca, what doest thou?’ and Casca in Greek to
his brother: ‘Brother, helpe me.’”</p>

<p>But some of Shakespeare’s interpolations are, probably unawares to
himself, of a vital and radical kind, and affect the conception of the
chief characters and the whole idea of the story. Take, for example,
Brutus’ soliloquy, as he rids himself of his hesitations and scruples.
This, from beginning to end, is the handiwork of Shakespeare:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>These words are so unlike, or, rather, so opposite to all that we
should have expected, that Coleridge cannot repress his amazement. He
comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This speech is singular:—at least, I do not
at present see into Shakespeare’s motive, his <i>rationale</i>, or in
what point of view he meant Brutus’ character to appear. For surely ...
nothing can seem more discordant with our historical preconceptions
of Brutus, or more lowering to the intellect of the Stoico-Platonic
tyrannicide, than the tenets here attributed to him—to him, the stern
Roman republican; namely,—that he would have no objection to a king, or
to Caesar, a monarch in Rome, would Caesar but be as good a monarch as
he now seems disposed to be.</p>

<p class="author">(<i>Lectures and Notes of 1818.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>And this in a way is the crucial statement of Brutus’ case. Here he has
tried to get rid of the assumptions that move himself and the rest,
and seeks to find something that will satisfy his reason. It is thus
a more intimate revelation of his deliberate principles, though not
necessarily of his subconscious instincts or his untested opinions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
than other utterances in which he lets feeling or circumstance have
sway. Of these there are two that do not quite coincide with it. One of
them is not very important, and in any case would not bring him nearer
to the antique conception. In his plea for a pure administration of
affairs, he asks Cassius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">What, shall one of us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That struck the foremost man of all this world</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But for supporting robbers, shall we now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 21.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But this, one feels, is merely an <i>argumentum ad
hominem</i>, brought forward very much in afterthought for a particular
purpose. At the time, neither in Brutus’ speeches to himself or others,
nor in the discussions of the conspirators, is Caesar accused of
countenancing peculation, or is this made a handle against him. And if
it were, it would not be incompatible with acquiescence in a royal
government.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
The other is the exclamation with which he “pieces out” the anonymous
letter that Cassius had left unfinished:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome?</div>
    <div class="verse indent34">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 52.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This certainly has somewhat of the republican ring. It breathes the
same spirit as Cassius’ own avowal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I had as lief not be, as live to be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In awe of such a thing as I myself;</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 95.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">except that Cassius feels Caesar’s predominance
to be a personal affront, while Brutus characteristically extends his
view to the whole community. But here Brutus is speaking under the
excitement of Cassius’ “instigation,” and making himself Cassius’
mouthpiece to fill in the blanks. Assuredly the declaration is not on
that account the less personal to himself; nevertheless in it Brutus,
no longer attempting to square his action with his theory, falls
back on the blind impulses of blood that he shares with the other
aristocrats of Rome. And in this, the most republican and the only
republican sentiment that falls from his lips, which for the rest is
so little republican that it might be echoed by the loyal subject of a
limited monarchy, it is only the negative aspect of the matter and the
public <i>amour propre</i> that are considered. Of the positive essence
of republicanism, of enthusiasm for a state in which all the lawful
authority is derived from the whole body of fully qualified citizens,
there is, despite Brutus’ talk of freemen and slaves and Caesar’s
ambition, no trace whatever in any of his utterances from first to
last. It has been said that Plutarch’s Brutus could live nowhere but in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
a self-governing commonwealth; Shakespeare’s Brutus would be quite
at home under a constitutional king and need not have found life
intolerable even in Tudor England. This indeed is an exaggeration.
True, in his soliloquy he bases his whole case on the deterioration
of Caesar’s nature that kingship might bring about; and if it were
proved, as it easily could be from instances like that of Numa, which
Shakespeare and therefore Shakespeare’s Brutus knew, that no such
result need follow, his entire sorites would seem to snap. But though
the form of his reflection is hypothetical and the hypothesis will
not hold, the substance is categorical enough. Brutus has such inbred
detestation of the royal power that practically he assumes it must
beyond question be mischievous in its moral effects. This, however,
is no reasoned conviction, though it is the starting point for what
he means to be a dispassionate argument, but a dogma of traditional
passion. And even were it granted it would not make Brutus a true
representative of classic republicanism. Shakespeare has so little
comprehension of the antique point of view that to him a thoughtful
and public-spirited citizen can find a rational apology for violent
measures only by looking at Caesar’s future and not at all by looking
at Caesar’s past. This Elizabethan Brutus sees nothing to blame in
Caesar’s previous career. He has not known “when his affections
(<i>i.e.</i> passions) sway’d more than his reason,” and implies that
he has not hitherto disjoined “remorse (<i>i.e.</i> scrupulousness)
from power.” Yet as Coleridge pertinently asks, was there nothing “in
Caesar’s past conduct as a man” to call for Brutus’ censure? “Had he
not passed the Rubicon,” and the like? But such incidents receive no
attention. Perhaps Shakespeare thought no more of Caesar’s crossing the
Rubicon to suppress Pompey and put an end to the disorders of Rome,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
than of Richmond’s crossing the Channel to suppress Richard III., and
put end to the Wars of the Roses. At any rate he makes no mention of
these and similar grounds of offence, though all or most of them were
set down in his authority.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Shakespeare’s position may be thus described. He read in Plutarch that
Brutus, the virtuous Roman, killed Caesar, the master-spirit of his own
and perhaps of any age, from a disinterested sense of duty. That was
easy to understand, for Shakespeare would know, and if he did not know
it from his own experience his well-conned translation of Montaigne
would teach him, that the best of men are determined in their feeling
of right by the preconceptions of race, class, education and the like.
But he also read that Brutus was a philosophic student who would not
accept or obey the current code without scrutinising it and fitting it
into his theory. Of the political theory, however, which such an one
would have, Shakespeare had no knowledge or appreciation. So whenever
Brutus tries to harmonise his purpose with his idealist doctrine, he
has to be furnished with new reasons instead of the old and obvious
ones. And these are neither very clear nor very antique. They make one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
inclined to quote concerning him the words of Caesar spoken to Cicero
in regard to the historical Brutus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I knowe not what this young man woulde, but what he woulde he
willeth it vehemently.</p>

<p class="author">(<i>Marcus Brutus.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">For what is it that he would? The one argument
with which he can excuse to his own heart the projected murder, is
that the aspirant to royal power, though hitherto irreproachable, may
or must become corrupted and misuse his high position. This is as
different from the attitude of the ancient Roman as it well could be.
It would never have occurred to the genuine republican of olden time
that any justification was needed for despatching a man who sought to
usurp the sovereign place; and if it had, this is certainly the last
justification that would have entered his head.</p>

<p>But the introspection, the self-examination, the craving for an inward
moral sanction that will satisfy the conscience, and the choice of the
particular sanction that does so, are as typical of the modern as they
are alien to the classical mind. It is clear that an addition of this
kind is not merely mechanical or superficial. It affects the elements
already given, and produces, as it were, a new chemical combination.
And this particular instance shows how Shakespeare transforms the
whole story. He reanimates Brutus by infusing into his veins a strain
of present feeling that in some ways transmutes his character; and,
transmuting the character in which the chief interest centres, he
cannot leave the other <i>data</i> as they were. He can resuscitate
the past in its persons, its conflicts, its palpitating vitality just
because he endows it with his own life. It was an ancient belief that
the shades of the departed were inarticulate or dumb till they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
lapped a libation of warm blood; then they would speak forth their
secrets. In like manner it is the life-blood of Shakespeare’s own
passion and thought that throbs in the pulses of these unsubstantial
dead and gives them human utterance once more. This, however, has two
aspects. It is the dead who speak; but they speak through the life
that Shakespeare has lent them. The past is resuscitated; but it is
a resuscitation, not the literal existence it had before. Nor in any
other way can the phantoms of history win bodily shape and perceptible
motion for the world of breathing men.</p>

<p>This may be illustrated by comparing Shakespeare’s <i>Julius Caesar</i>
with the <i>Julius Caesar</i> of Sir William Alexander, afterwards
Earl of Stirling, which seems to have been written a few years later
than its more illustrious namesake. Alexander was an able man and a
considerable poet, from whom Shakespeare himself did not disdain to
borrow hints for Prospero’s famous reflections on the transitoriness
of things. He used virtually the same sources as Shakespeare, like
him making Plutarch his chief authority, and to supplement Plutarch,
betaking himself, as Shakespeare may also have done, to the tradition
set in France by Muretus, Grévin, and Garnier. So they build on much
the same sites and with much the same timber. But their methods are
as different as can well be imagined. Alexander is by far the more
scrupulous in his reproduction of the old-world record. He adopts the
Senecan type of tragedy, exaggerating its indifference to movement and
fondness for lengthy harangues; and this enables him to preserve much
of the narrative in its original form without thorough reduction to the
category of action. This also in large measure exempts him from the
need of reorganising his material: practically a single situation is
given, and whatever else of the story is required, has to be conveyed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
in the words of the persons, who can repeat things just as they have
been reported. And proceeding in this way Alexander can include as much
as he pleases of Plutarch’s abundance, a privilege of which he avails
himself to the utmost. Few are the details that he must absolutely
reject, for they can always be put in somebody’s mouth; he is slow to
tamper with Plutarch’s location of them; and he never connects them
more closely than Plutarch has authorised. He does not extract from
his document inferences that have not already been drawn, nor falsify
it with picturesque touches that have not been already supplied, and
he would not dream of contradicting it in small things or great. Even
Brutus’ republicanism is sacred to the author of this “Monarchic
Tragedy,” though he was to be Secretary of State to Charles I. and
noted for his advocacy of Divine Right. He has a convenient theory to
justify Brutus as much as is necessary from his point of view. He makes
him explain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If Caesar had been born or chused our prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then those, who durst attempt to take his life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The world of treason justly might convince.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let still the states, which flourish for the time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By subjects be inviolable thought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And those (no doubt) commit a monstrous crime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who lawfull soveraignty prophane in ought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we must think (though now thus brought to bow)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The senate, king; a subject Caesar is:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soveraignty whom violating now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The world must damne, as having done amisse.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Brutus’ motives, which Shakespeare sophisticates,
can thus be left him. But does this bit of reasoning, which reads like
a passage from the <i>Leviathan</i>, and explains why King James called
Alexander “My philosophical poet,” really come nearer the historic
truth than the heart-searching of Shakespeare’s Brutus? And does
Alexander, taking Brutus’ convictions at second hand and manufacturing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
an apology for them, do much more to revive the real Brutus, than
Shakespeare, whose fervid imagination drives him to realise Brutus’
inmost heart, and who just for that reason</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">seeks into him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For that which is not in him?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here and generally Alexander gives the exacter, if not the more
faithful transcript, but the main truth, the truth of life, escapes
him; and therefore, too, despite all his painstaking fidelity, he is
apt to miss even the vital touches that Plutarch gives. We have seen
with what reverent accuracy Shakespeare reproduces the conversation
between Brutus and Portia. In a certain way Alexander is more accurate
still. Portia pleads:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I was not (Brutus) match’d with thee to be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A partner onely of thy boord and bed;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Who but for pleasure or for wealth did wed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No, Portia spoused thee minding to remaine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy fortunes partner, whether good or ill: ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thus thou seek thy sorrows to conceale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Through a distrust, or a mistrust of me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then to the world what way can I reveale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How great a matter I would do for thee?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And though our sexe too talkative be deem’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As those whose tongues import our greatest pow’rs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For secrets still bad treasurers esteem’d,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Good education may reforme defects,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this may leade me to a vertuous life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Whil’st such rare patterns generous worth respects)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I Cato’s daughter am, and Brutus wife.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet would I not repose my trust in ought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still thinking that thy crosse was great to beare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till I my courage to a tryall brought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which suffering for thy cause can nothing feare:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For first to try how that I could comport</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With sterne afflictions sprit-enfeebling blows,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Since thy distresse strikes deeper in my heart,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
And Brutus answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou must (deare love!) that which thou sought’st, receive;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy heart so high a saile in stormes still beares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thy great courage does deserve to have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our enterprise entrusted to thine eares.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Here, with the rhetorical amplification which was the chief and almost
sole liberty that Alexander allowed himself, Plutarch’s train of
thought is more closely followed than by Shakespeare himself. King
James’s “philosophical poet” does not even suppress the tribute to
education, but rather calls attention to the edifying “sentence” by
the expedient less common west of the Channel than among his French
masters, of placing it within inverted commas. But, besides lowering
the temperature of the whole, he characteristically omits the most
important passage, at least in so far as Brutus is concerned, his
prayer that “he might be founde a husband, worthie of so noble a wife
as Porcia.”</p>

<p>Suppose that a conscientious draughtsman and a painter of genius were
moved to reproduce the impression that a group of antique statuary had
made on them, using the level surface which alone is at their disposal.
The one might choose his station, and set down with all possible
precision in his black and white as much as was given him to see. The
other taking into account the different conditions of the pictorial and
the plastic art, might visualise what seemed to him the inmost meaning
to his own mind in his own way, and represent it, the same yet not the
same, in all the glory of colour. The former would deliver a version
more useful to the historian of sculpture were the original to be lost,
but one in which we should miss many beauties of detail, and from
which the indwelling spirit would have fled. The latter would not give
much help to an antiquarian knowledge of the archetype, but he might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
transmit its inspiration, and rouse kindred feelings in an even greater
degree just because they were mingled with others that came from his
own heart.</p>

<p>The analogy is, of course, an imperfect one, for the problem of
rendering the solid on the flat is not on all fours with the problem
of converting Plutarch’s <i>Lives</i> to modern plays. But it applies
to this extent, that in both cases the task is to interpret a subject,
that has received one kind of treatment, by a treatment that is quite
dissimilar. And the difference between William Alexander and William
Shakespeare is very much the difference between the conscientious
draughtsman and the inspired artist.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE TITULAR HERO OF THE PLAY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The modification of Brutus’ character typifies and involves the
modification of the whole story, because the tragic interest is
focussed in his career. This must be remembered, if we would avoid
misconception. It has sometimes been said that the play suffers from
lack of unity, that the titular hero is disposed of when it is half
through, and that thereafter attention is diverted to the murderer.
But this criticism is beside the point. Really, from beginning to
end, Brutus is the prominent figure, and if the prominent figure
should supply the name, then, as Voltaire pointed out, the drama ought
properly to be called <i>Marcus Brutus</i>. If we look at it in this
way, there is no lack of unity, though possibly there is a misnomer.
Throughout the piece it is the personality of Brutus that attracts our
chief sympathy and concern. If he is dismissed to a subordinate place,
the result is as absurd as it would be were Hamlet thus treated in the
companion tragedy; while, his position, once recognised, everything
becomes coherent and clear.</p>

<p>But when this is the case, why should Shakespeare not say so? Why,
above all, should he use a false designation to mix the trail?</p>

<p>It has been answered that he was wholly indifferent to labels and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
nomenclature, that he gives his plays somewhat irrelevant titles, such
as <i>Twelfth Night</i>, or lets people christen them at their fancy,
<i>What You Will</i>, or <i>As You Like It</i>. Just in the same way,
as a shrewd theatrical manager with his eye on the audience, he may
have turned to account the prevalent curiosity about Caesar, without
inquiring too curiously whether placard and performance tallied in
every respect.</p>

<p>And doubtless such considerations were not unknown to him. Shakespeare,
as is shown by the topical allusions in which his works abound, by
no means disdained the maxim that the playwright must appeal to the
current interests of his public, even to those that are adventitious
and superficial. At the same time, it is only his comedies, in which
his whole method is less severe, that have insignificant or arbitrary
titles. There is no instance of a tragedy being misnamed. On the
contrary, the chief person or persons are always indicated, and in
this way Shakespeare has protested in advance against the mistake of
viewing <i>King Lear</i> as a whole with reference to Cordelia, or
<i>Macbeth</i> as a whole with reference to Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>But in the second place, <i>Julius Caesar</i>, both in its
chronological position and in its essential character, comes as near
to the Histories as to the Tragedies; and the Histories are all named
after the sovereign in whose reign most of the events occurred. He
may not have the chief role, which, for example, belongs in <i>King
John</i> to the Bastard, and in <i>Henry IV.</i> to Prince Hal. He may
even drop out in the course of the story, which, for example, in the
latter play is continued for an entire act after the King’s death: but
he serves, as it were, for a landmark, to date and localise the action.
It is not improbable that this was the light in which Shakespeare
regarded Caesar. In those days people did not make fine distinctions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
He was generally viewed as first in the regular succession of Emperors,
and in so far could be considered to have held the same sort of
position in Rome, as any of those who had sat on the throne of England.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Though it is manifest that Brutus is the principal
character, the <i>protagonist</i>, the chief representative of the
action, the central figure among the living agents, the interest of his
career lies in its mistaken and futile opposition to Julius, to the
idea of Caesarism, to what again and again, in the course of the play,
is called “the spirit of Caesar.” The expression is often repeated.
Brutus declares the purpose of the conspirators:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">In our own proper entrails.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<i>V.</i> iii. 95.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is really Caesar’s presence, his genius,
his conception that dominates the story. Brutus is first among the
struggling mortals who obey even while resisting their fate, but
the fate itself is the imperialist inspiration which makes up the
significance of Caesar, and the play therefore is fitly named after
him.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>This is brought home to us in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>In the first place, Shakespeare makes it abundantly clear that the
rule of the single master-mind is the only admissible solution for the
problem of the time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>Caesar, with his transcendent gifts, was chosen by Providence to
preserve the Roman State from shipwreck, and steer it on its triumphant
course; and even if the helmsman perished, the course was set.
Shakespeare was guided to this view by Plutarch. The celebrant of the
life of ancient Greece was indeed very far from idealising the man who
consolidated the supremacy of Rome. He records impartially and with
appreciation, some of his noble traits, and without extenuation many
that were not admirable. But he “honours his memory” very much “on this
side idolatry,” reserves his chief enthusiasm for Brutus, and never
seems to take a full view of Caesar’s unique greatness in the mass.
None the less, he is now and again forced to admit that he was the man,
and his were the methods that the emergency required. Thus talking of
the bribery and violence that then prevailed in Rome he remarks:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Men of deepe judgement and discression seeing
such furie and madnes of the people, thought them selves happy if the
common wealth were no worse troubled, then with the absolut state of a
Monarchy and soveraine Lord to governe them. Furthermore, there were
many that were not affraid to speake it openly, that there was no other
help to remedy the troubles of the common wealth, but by the authority
of one man only that should commaund them all.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Again, commenting on the accident by which Brutus did not learn of the
victory that might have averted his final defeat, he has the weighty
reflection;</p>

<p class="blockquot">Howbeit the state of Rome (in my opinion) being
now brought to that passe, that it could no more abide to be governed
by many Lordes, but required one only absolute Governor: God, to
prevent Brutus that it shoulde not come to his government, kept this
victorie from his knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>And in one of those comparisons that Montaigne loved, he is more
emphatic still:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Howbeit Caesars power and government when it came
to be established, did in deede much hurte at his first entrie and
beginning unto those that did resist him: but afterwardes unto them
that being overcome had received his government, it seemed he had
rather the name and opinion<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
onely of a tyranne, then otherwise that he was so in deed. For there
never followed any tyrannicall nor cruell act, but contrarilie, it
seemed that he was a mercifull Phisition, whom God had ordeyned of
speciall grace to be Governor of the Empire of Rome, and to set all
thinges againe at quiet stay, the which required the counsell and
authoritie of an absolute Prince.... But the fame of Julius Caesar did
set up his friends againe after his death, and was of such force, that
it raised a young stripling, Octavius Caesar, (that had no meanes nor
power of him selfe) to be one of the greatest men of Rome.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>On these isolated hints Shakespeare seizes. He amplifies them and works
them out in his conception of the situation.</p>

<p>The vast territory that is subject to Rome, of which we have glimpses
as it stretches north and west to Gaul and Spain, of which we visit the
Macedonian and Asiatic provinces in the east and south, has need of
wise and steady government. But is that to be got from the Romans? The
plebeians are represented as fickle and violent, greedy and irrational,
the dupes of dead tradition, parasites in the living present. They have
shouted for Pompey, they strew flowers for Caesar: they can be tickled
with talk of their ancient liberties, they can be cajoled by the tricks
of shifty rhetoric: they cheer when their favourite refuses the crown,
they wish to crown his “better parts” in his murderer: they will not
hear a word against Brutus, they rush off to fire his house: they tear
a man to pieces on account of his name, and hold Caesar beyond parallel
on account of his bequest.</p>

<p>Nor are things better with the aristocrats. Cassius, the moving
spirit of the opposition, is, at his noblest, actuated by jealousy of
greatness. And he is not always at his noblest. He confesses that had he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
been in Caesar’s good graces, he would have been on Caesar’s side.
This strain of servility is more apparent in the flatteries and
officiousness of Decius and Casca. And what is its motive? Cassius
seeks to win Antony by promising him an equal voice in disposing of the
dignities: and he presently uses his position for extortion and the
patronage of corruption. Envy, ambition, cupidity are the governing
principles of the governing classes: and their enthusiasm for freedom
means nothing more than an enthusiasm for prestige and influence,
for the privilege of parcelling out the authority and dividing the
spoils. What case have these against the Man of Destiny, whose genius
has given compass, peace, and security to the Roman world? But their
plea of liberty misleads the unpractical student, the worshipper of
dreams, memories, and ideals, behind whose virtue they shelter their
selfish aims, and whose countenance alone can make their conspiracy
respectable. With his help they achieve a momentary triumph. But of
course it leads not to a renovation of the republic, but to domestic
confusion and to a multiplication of oppressors. So far as the populace
is concerned, the removal of the master means submission to the
unprincipled orator, who, with his fellow triumvirs, cheats it of its
inheritance and sets about a wholesale proscription. So far as the
Empire is concerned, the civil war is renewed, and the provincials are
pillaged by the champions of freedom. Brutus sees too late that it
is vain to strive against the “spirit of Caesar,” which is bound to
prevail, and which, though it may be impeded, cannot be defeated. He is
ruined with the cause he espoused, and confesses fairly vanquished:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">v.</span> iii. 94.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Again, though it may seem paradoxical to say so, the all-compelling
power of Caesar’s ideal is indicated in the presentation of his own
character. This at first sight is something of a riddle and a surprise.
Shakespeare, as is shown by his many tributes elsewhere, had ample
perception and appreciation of Caesar’s greatness. Yet in the play
called after him it almost seems as though he had a sharper eye for any
of the weaknesses and foibles that Plutarch records of him, and even
went about to exaggerate them and add to them.</p>

<p>Thus great stress is laid on his physical disabilities. When the crown
is offered him, he swoons, as Casca narrates, for, as Brutus remarks,
he is subject to the falling sickness. There is authority for these
statements. But Cassius describes how his strength failed him in the
Tiber and how he shook with fever in Spain, and both these touches are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
added by Shakespeare. Nor is it the malcontents alone who signalise
such defects. Caesar himself admits that he is deaf, though of his
deafness history knows nothing.</p>

<p>And not only does Shakespeare accentuate these bodily infirmities; he
introduces them in such a way and in such a connection that they convey
an ironical suggestion and almost make the Emperor ridiculous. At the
great moment when he is putting by the coronet tendered him by Antony
that he may take with the more security and dignity the crown which
the Senate will vote him, precisely then he falls down in a fit. This
indeed is quasi-historical, but the other and more striking instances
are forged in Shakespeare’s smithy. It is just after his overweening
challenge to the swimming-match that he must cry for aid: “Help me,
Cassius, or I sink” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 3). In his
fever, as Cassius maliciously notes,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">That tongue of his that bade the Romans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas, it cried ‘Give me some drink, Titinius,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a sick girl.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 125.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">A pretty saying to chronicle. He says superbly to
Mark Antony, “Always I am Caesar”; and in the very next line follows
the anticlimax:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 213.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But if his physical defects, which after all have little to do with the
real greatness of the man save in the eyes of spiteful detractors, are
thus brought into satirical relief, much more is this the case with his
mental and moral failings, which of course concern the heart of his
character.</p>

<p>Already on his first appearance, we see this lord of the world the
credulous believer in magic rites. At the Lupercal he enjoins Calpurnia
to “stand directly in Antonius’ way” and Antony to touch her in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
“holy chase” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 3 and 8), and he impresses on Antony the
observance of all the ritual: “Leave no ceremony out” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii.
11). It was not ever thus. The time has been when he held these things
at their true value, and it is only recently, as watchful eyes take
note, that his attitude has changed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He is superstitious grown of late,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quite from the main opinion he held once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 195.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And this is no mere invention of the enemy.
He does have recourse to sacrifice, he does inquire of the priests
“their opinions of success” (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> ii. 5);
though afterwards, on the news of the portent, he tries to put his own
interpretation on it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The gods do this in shame of cowardice:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Caesar should be a beast without a heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he should stay at home to-day for fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 41.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He is really impressed by his wife’s cries in her
sleep, as appears from his words to himself, when he has not to keep
up appearances before others, but enters, perturbed, in his nightgown,
and seems urged by his anxiety to consult the oracles. He affects to
dismiss the signs and omens:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">These predictions</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are to the world in general as to Caesar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent33">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 28.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But it is clear that he attaches importance
to them, for, when Decius gives Calpurnia’s dream an auspicious
interpretation, he accepts it, and once again changing his mind,
presently resolves to set out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am ashamed I did yield to them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me my robe, for I will go.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 105.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus we see a touch of self-deception as well as of superstition in
Caesar, and this self-deception reappears in other more important
matters. He affects an absolute fearlessness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It seems to me most strange that men should fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 33.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
His courage, of course, is beyond question; but is there not a hint of
the theatrical in this overstrained amazement, in this statement that
fear is the most unaccountable thing in all his experience? One recalls
the story of the young soldier who said that he knew not what it was to
be afraid, and received his commander’s answer: “Then you have never
snuffed a candle with your fingers.” That was the reproof of bravado
by bravery in the mouth of a man so fearless that he could afford
to acknowledge his acquaintance with fear. And surely Caesar could
have afforded to do so too. We see and know that he is the bravest of
the brave, but if anything could make us suspicious, it would be his
constant harping on his flawless valour. So, too, he says of Cassius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">I fear him not:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet if my name were liable to fear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I do not know the man I should avoid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So soon as that spare Cassius ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I rather tell thee what is to be fear’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 198, 211.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Why should he labour the point? If he has not
fears, he has at least misgivings in regard to Cassius, that come very
much to the same thing. His anxiety is obvious, as he calls Antony to
his side to catechise him on his opinions of the danger.</p>

<p>In the same way he prides himself on his inaccessibility to adulation
and blandishments.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">These couchings and these lowly courtesies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might fire the blood of ordinary men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And turn pre-ordinance and first decree</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the law of children. Be not fond</div>

    <div class="verse indent33">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 36.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>We may believe that he does indeed stand secure against the grosser<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
kinds of parasites and their more obvious devices; but that does not
mean that he cannot be hood-winked by meaner men who know how to play on
his self-love. Decius says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I can o’ersway him: for he loves to hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That unicorns may be betray’d with trees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He says he does, being then most flattered.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me work.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 203.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And Decius makes his words good.</p>

<p>In like manner he fancies that he possesses an insight that reads
men’s souls at a glance. When he hears the cry: “Beware the Ides of
March,” he gives the command, “Set him before me; let me see his face.”
A moment’s inspection is enough: “He is a dreamer: let us leave him:
pass” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 24). Yet he fails to read
the treachery of the conspirators, though they are daily about him,
consults with Decius whom he “loves,” and bids Trebonius be near him.</p>

<p>And then he elects to pose as no less immovable in resolution than
infallible in judgment. When we have been witnesses of all his
vacillation and shilly-shally about attending the senate meeting—now
he would, now he would not, and again he would—it is hard to suppress
the jeer at the high-sounding words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I could be well moved, if I were as you:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Of whose true-fix’d and resting quality</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is no fellow in the firmament.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The skies are painted with unnumber’d sparks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They are all fire, and every one doth shine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But there’s but one in all doth hold his place:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So in the world: ’tis furnish’d well with men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet in the number I do know but one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That unassailable holds on his rank,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me a little show it, even in this.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 58.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Now, all these things are wholly or mainly the fabrications of
Shakespeare. In Plutarch Caesar does not direct Calpurnia to put
herself in Antony’s way, nor is there any indication that he attached
importance to the rite. It is in the wife and not in the husband that
Plutarch notes an unexpected strain of credulity, remarking with
reference to her dream: “Capurnia untill that time was never geven to
any feare or supersticion.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
Plutarch cites noble sayings of Caesar’s in regard to fear, for
instance that “it was better to dye once, than alwayes to be affrayed of
death:”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
but he never attributes to him any pretence of immunity from human
frailty, and makes him explicitly avow the feeling in the very passage
where in Shakespeare he disclaims it. “‘As for those fatte men, with
smooth comed heades,’ quoth he, ‘I never reckon of them: but these pale
visaged and carian leane people, I feare them most.’” The dismissal of
the soothsayer after a contemptuous glance is unwarranted by Plutarch.
There is no authority for his defencelessness among flatterers, or
for his illusion that he is superior to their arts. Yielding in quite
a natural way and without any hesitation to the solicitations of
Calpurnia and the reports of the bad omens, Caesar in Plutarch resolves
to stay at home, but afterwards is induced to change his mind by
Decius’ very plausible arguments. There is no hint of unsteadiness in
his conduct, as there described; nor in the final scene is there any of
the ostentation but only the reality of firmness in his rejection of
Metellus Cimber’s petition.</p>

<p>Considering all this it is not difficult to understand the indignation
of the critics who complain that Shakespeare has here given a libel
rather than a portrait of Caesar, and has substituted impertinent cavil
for sympathetic interpretation. And some of Shakespeare’s apologists
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
have accepted this statement of the case, but have sought to defend
the supposed travesty on the ground that it is prescribed by the
subject and the treatment. Thus Dr. Hudson suggests<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
that “the policy of the drama may have been to represent Caesar, not as
he was indeed, but as he must have appeared to the conspirators; to make
us see him as they saw him; in order that they might have fair and
equal justice at our hands.” With a slight variation this is also the
opinion of Gervinus:<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
“The poet, if he intended to make the attempt of the conspirators his
main theme, could not have ventured to create too great an interest
in Caesar: it was necessary to keep him in the background, and to
present that view of him which gave reason for the conspiracy.” And
alleging, what would be hard to prove, that in Plutarch, Caesar’s
character “altered much for the worse, shortly before his death,” he
continues, in reference to his arrogance: “It is intended with few
words to show him at that point when his behaviour would excite those
free spirits against him.” But this explanation will hardly bear
scrutiny. In the first place: if Shakespeare’s object had been to
provide a relative justification for the assassins, he could have done
so much more naturally and effectively by adhering to the <i>data</i>
of the <i>Life</i>. Among them he could have found graver causes of
resentment against Caesar than any of those he invents, which at the
worst are peccadillos and affectations rather than real delinquencies.
And Plutarch does not slur them over: on the contrary the shadows in
his picture are strongly marked, and he lays a long list of offences to
Caesar’s score; culminating in what he calls the “shamefullest part”
that he played, to wit, his support of Clodius. Here was matter enough
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
for the dramatic <i>Advocatus Diaboli</i>. It would have been as
easy to weave some of these damaging stories into the reminiscences
of Cassius, as to concoct harmless fictions about Caesar’s having
a temperature and being thirsty, or his failing to swim a river in
flood. All these bygone scandals, whether domestic or political, would
have immensely strengthened the conspirators’ case, especially with a
precisian like Brutus. But Shakespeare is silent concerning them, and
Brutus, as we have seen, gives Caesar in regard to his antecedents a
clean bill of health. Of course almost all Caesar’s previous history
is taken for granted and left to the imagination, but the dubious
passages are far more persistently kept out of sight than such as tend
to his glory. And that is the bewildering thing, if Shakespeare’s
delineation was meant to explain the attitude of the faction. It is
surely an odd way of winning our good will for a man’s murderers
to keep back notorious charges against him of cruelty, treason and
unscrupulousness, to certify that he has never abused his powers or let
his passion overmaster his reason, and then to trump up stories that he
gives himself airs and is deaf in one ear. It reminds one of Swift’s
description of Arbuthnot: “Our doctor has every quality and virtue that
can make a man amiable or useful; but, alas, he hath a sort of slouch
in his walk.” Swift, however, was not explaining how people might come
to think that Dr. Arbuthnot should be got rid of.</p>

<p>Again his tendency to parade by no means alters the fact, that he does
possess in an extraordinary degree the intellectual and moral virtues
that he would exaggerate in his own eyes and the eyes of others.
Independence, resolution, courage, insight must have been his in
amplest store or he would never have been able to</p>

and there is evidence of them in the play. He is not moved by the
deferential prayers of the senators: he does persist in the banishment
of Publius Cimber; he has in very truth read the heart and taken the

<p class="no-indent">he neither shrinks nor complains when the fatal
moment comes. The impression he makes on the unsophisticated mind, on
average audiences and the elder school of critics, is undoubtedly an
heroic one. It is only minute analysis that discovers his defects, and
though the defects are certainly present and should be noted, they are
far from sufficing to make the general effect absurd or contemptible.
If they do so, we give them undue importance. It was not so that
Shakespeare meant them to be taken. For he has invented for his Caesar
not only these trivial blemishes, but several conspicuous exhibitions
of nobility, which Plutarch nowhere suggests; and this should give
pause to such as find in Shakespeare’s portrait merely a wilful or
wanton caricature. Thus in regard to the interposition of Artemidorus,
Shakespeare read in North:</p>

<p class="blockquot">He marking howe Caesar received all the
supplications that were offered him, and that he gave them straight to
his men that were about him, pressed neerer to him and sayed: “Caesar,
reade this memoriall to your selfe, and that quickely, for they be
matters of great waight and touch you neerely.” Caesar tooke it of him,
<i>but coulde never reade it, though he many times attempted it</i>,
for the multitude of people that did salute him: but holding it
still in his hande, keeping it to him selfe, went on withall into the
Senate house.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">Compare this with the scene in the play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Artemidorus.</i> Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.</div>

<p class="no-indent">Can one say that Shakespeare has defrauded
Caesar of his magnanimity?</p>

<p>Or again observe, in the imaginary conclusion to the unrecorded
remonstrances of Calpurnia, how loftily he refuses to avail himself
of the little white untruths that after all pass current as quite
excusable in society. They are beneath his dignity. He turns to Decius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Caesar.</i>    You are come in very happy time,</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 60.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But this last instance is not merely an example of Shakespeare’s homage
to Caesar’s grandeur and his eagerness to enhance it with accessories
of his own contrivance. It gives us a clue to the secret of his
additions both favourable and the reverse, and points the way to his
conception of the man. For observe that this refusal of Caesar’s to
make use of a falsehood is an afterthought. A minute before he has,
also in words that Shakespeare puts in his mouth, fully consented to
the proposal that he should feign illness. He pacifies Calpurnia:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This compliance he makes to his wife, but in
presence of Decius Brutus he recovers himself and adopts the stricter
standard. What does this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg
228]</span> imply? Does it not mean that in a certain sense he is
playing a part and aping the Immortal to be seen of men?</p>

<p>Let us consider the situation. Caesar, a man with the human frailties,
mental and physical, which are incident to men, is nevertheless endowed
by the Higher Powers with genius that has raised him far above his
fellows. By his genius he has conceived and grasped and done much to
realise the sublime idea of the Roman Empire. By his genius he has
raised himself to the headship of that great Empire which his own
thought was creating. Private ambitions may have urged and doubtful
shifts may have helped his career. He himself feels that within his
drapery of grand exploits there is something that will not bear
scrutiny; and hence his mistrust of Cassius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He is a great observer and he looks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quite through the deeds of men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 201.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But these things are behind him and a luminous veil is drawn over
them, beyond which we discern him only as “the foremost man of all
this world,” “the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times,”
devoted to the cause of Rome, fighting and conquering for her; filling
her public treasuries, her general coffers, with gold; sympathising
with her poor to whom it will be found only after his death that he has
left his wealth. The only hints of unrighteous dealing on his part are
given in Artemidorus’ statement to himself: “Thou hast wronged Caius
Ligarius,” and in Brutus’ statement about him that he was slain “but
for supporting robbers.” But it is never suggested that he himself was
guilty of robbery: and the wrong to Ligarius, who was accused “for
taking parte with Pompey,” and “thanked not Caesar so muche for his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
discharge, as he was offended with him for that he was brought in
daunger by his tyrannicall power,”<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
hardly deserves the name, at least in the common acceptation. Besides
Shakespeare has a large tolerance for the practical statesman when
dowered with patriotism, insight, and resolution; and will not lightly
condemn him because he must use sorry tools, and takes some soil from
the world, and is not unmoved by personal interests. Provided that
his more selfish aims coincide with the good of the whole, and that
he has veracity of intellect to understand, with steadiness of will
to satisfy the needs of the time, Shakespeare will vindicate for him
his share of prosperity, honour, and desert. And this seems to be,
in glorified version, his view of Caesar. The only serious charge he
brings against him in the play, the only charge to which he recurs
elsewhere, is that he was ambitious. But ambition is not wholly of sin,
and brings forth good as well as evil fruit. Indeed when a man’s desire
for the first place merges in the desire for the fullest opportunity,
and that again in the desire for the task he feels he can do best, it
is distinguishable from a virtue, if at all, only by the demand that
he shall be the agent. So is it, to compare celebrities of local and
of universal history, with the ambitious strain in the character of
Henry IV.; it is not incompatible with sterling worth that commands
solid success; it spurs him to worthy deeds that redeem the offences
it exacts; and these offences themselves in some sort “tend the profit
of the state.” No doubt with both men their ambition brings its own
Nemesis, the ceaseless care of the one, the premature death of the
other. But that need not prevent recognition of their high qualities,
or their just claims, or their providential mandate. Such men are
ministers of the Divine Purposes, as Plutarch said in regard to Caesar;
and in setting forth the essential meaning of his career, Shakespeare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
can scorn the base degrees by which he did ascend. Partly his less
creditable doings were necessary if he was to mount at all; partly
they may have seemed venial to the subject of the Tudor monarchy; at
worst, when compared with the splendour of his achievement, they were
spots in the sun. In any case they were not worth consideration. With
them Shakespeare is not concerned, but with the plenary inspiration of
Caesar’s life, the inspiration that made him an instrument of Heaven
and that was to bring peace and order to the world. So he passes over
the years of effort and preparation, showing their glories but slightly
and their trespasses not at all. He confines himself to the time when
the summit is reached and the dream is fulfilled. Then to his mind
begins the tragedy and the transfiguration.</p>

<p>He represents Caesar, like every truly great man, as carried away by
his own conception and made a slave to it. What a thing was this idea
of Empire, this “spirit of Caesar,” of which he as one of earth’s
mortal millions was but the vehicle and the organ! He himself as a
human person cannot withhold homage from himself as the incarnate
<i>Imperium</i>. Observe how he speaks of himself habitually in the
third person. Not “I do this,” but “Caesar does this,” “Caesar does
that,” alike when talking to the soothsayer, to his wife and to the
senate.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
It is almost as though he anticipated its later use as a common noun
equivalent to Emperor: for in all these passages he describes, as it
were, what the Emperor’s action and attitude should be. And that is the
secret of the strange impression that he makes. It is a case, an exaggerated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
case, of <i>noblesse oblige</i>. The Caesar, the first of those
Caesars who were to receive their apotheosis and be hailed as <i>Divi
Augusti</i>, must in literal truth answer Hobbes’ description of
the State, and be a mortal god. He must be fearless, omniscient,
infallible, without changeableness or shadow of turning: does he not
represent the empire? He has to live up to an impossible standard, and
so he must affect to be what he is not. He is the martyr of the idea
that has made his fortune. He must not listen to his instincts or his
misgivings; there is no room in the Caesar for timidity or mistake or
fickleness. But, alas! he is only a man, and as a man he constantly
gives the lie to the majesty which the spirit of Caesar enjoins. We
feel all the more strongly, since we are forced to the comparison,
the contrast between the shortcomings of the individual and the
splendour of the ideal role he undertakes. And not only that. In this
assumption of the Divine, involving as it does a touch of unreality
and falsehood, he has lost his old surety of vision and efficiency in
act. He tries to rise above himself, and pays the penalty by falling
below himself, and rushing on the ruin which a little vulgar shrewdness
would have avoided. But his mistake is due to his very greatness, and
his greatness encompasses him to the last, when with no futile and
undignified struggle, he wraps his face in his mantle and accepts the
end. Antony does not exaggerate when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I, and you, and all of us fell down;</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 194.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">for it was the Empire that fell. But to rise
again! For the idea of Caesarism, rid of the defects and limitations
of its originator, becomes only the more invincible, and the spirit of
Caesar begins its free untrammelled course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
The greatness of his genius cannot be fully realised unless the story
is carried on to the final triumph at Philippi, instead of breaking
off immediately after his bodily death. It is in part Shakespeare’s
perception of this and not merely his general superiority of power,
that makes his Caesar so much more impressive than the Caesar of
contemporary dramatists that seem to keep closer to their theme.</p>

<p>Not only then is <i>Julius Caesar</i> the right name for the play, in
so far as his imperialist idea dominates the whole, but a very subtle
interpretation of his character is given when, as this implies, he
is viewed as the exponent of Imperialism. None the less Brutus is
the leading personage, if we grant precedence in accordance with the
interest aroused.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE EXCELLENCES AND ILLUSIONS OF BRUTUS</span></h3>

<p>Thus Shakespeare has his Act of Oblivion for all that might give an
unfavourable impression of Caesar’s past, and presents him very much as
the incarnate principle of Empire, with the splendours but also with
the disabilities that must attend the individual man who feels himself
the vehicle for such an inspiration.</p>

<p>He somewhat similarly screens from view whatever in the career of
Brutus might prejudice his claims to affection and respect: and
carries much further a process of idealization that Plutarch had
already begun. For to Plutarch Brutus is, so to speak, the model
republican, the paragon of private and civic virtue. The promise to
the soldiers before the second battle at Philippi of two cities to
sack, calls forth the comment: “In all Brutus’ life there is but this
only fault to be found”: and even this, as the marginal note remarks,
is “wisely excused”; on the plea, namely, that after Cassius’ death
the difficulties were very great and the best had to be made of a bad
state of things. But no other misconduct is laid to his charge: his
extortionate usury and his abrupt divorce are passed over in silence.
All his doings receive indulgent construction, and the narrative is
often pointed with a formal <i>éloge</i>. In the <i>Comparison</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
where of course such estimates are expected, attention is drawn to
his rectitude, “only referring his frendschippe and enmitie unto the
consideracion of justice and equitie”; to “the marvelous noble minde of
him, that for fear never fainted nor let falle any part of his corage”;
to his influence over his associates so that “by his choyce of them he
made them good men”; to the honour in which he was held by his “verie
enemies.” But already the keynote is struck in the opening page:</p>

<p class="blockquot">This Marcus Brutus ... whose life we presently
wryte, having framed his manners of life by the rules of vertue and
studie of philosophie, and having employed his wit, which was gentle
and constant, in attempting of great things: me thinkes he was rightly
made and framed unto vertue.</p>

<p>And the story often deviates from its course into little backwaters
of commendation, as when after some censure of Cassius, we are told:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Brutus in contrary manner, for his vertue and
valliantnes, was well-beloved of the people and his owne, esteemed of
noble men, and hated of no man, not so much as of his enemies: bicause
he was a marvelous lowly and gentle person, noble minded, and would
never be in any rage, nor caried away with pleasure and covetousness,
but had ever an upright mind with him, and would never yeeld to any
wronge or injustice, the which was the chiefest cause of his fame, of
his rising, and of the good will that every man bare him: for they were
all perswaded that his intent was good.</p>

<p>This conception Shakespeare adopts and purifies. He leaves out the
shadow of that one fault that Plutarch wisely excused: he leaves out
too the unpleasant circumstance, which Plutarch apparently thought
needed no excuse, that Brutus was applicant for and recipient of
offices at the disposal of the all-powerful dictator. There must be
nothing to mar the graciousness and dignity of the picture. Shakespeare
wishes to portray a patriotic gentleman of the best Roman or the best
English type, such “a gentleman or noble person” as it was the aim of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Spenser’s <i>Faerie Queene</i> “to fashion in vertuous and gentle
discipline,” such a gentleman or noble person as Shakespeare’s
generation had seen in Spenser’s friend, Sir Philip Sidney. So
Plutarch’s summaries are expanded and filled in partly with touches
that his narrative supplies, partly with others that the summaries
themselves suggest.</p>

<p>To the latter class belongs the winning courtesy with which Brutus at
his first appearance excuses himself to Cassius for his preoccupation.
His inward trouble might well have stirred him to irritability and
abruptness; but he only feels that it has made him remiss, and that an
explanation is due from him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent25">Vexed I am</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of late with passions of some difference,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Conceptions only proper to myself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviours:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But let not therefore my good friends be grieved—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Among which number, Cassius, be you one—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor construe any further my neglect,</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 39.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So with his friends. Shakespeare invents the
character of Lucius to show how attentive and considerate Brutus is as
master. He apologises for having blamed his servant without cause.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 255.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>He notes compassionately that the lad is drowsy and overwatched
(<span class="smcap">iv.</span> iii. 241). At one time he dispenses with his services
because he is sleeping sound (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i. 229). At another he asks
a song from him not as a right but as a favour (<span class="smcap">iv.</span> iii. 256).
And immediately thereafter the master waits, as it were, on the nodding
slave, and removes his harp lest it should be broken.</p>

<p>But it is to his wife that he shows the full wealth of his affectionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
nature. He would fain keep from her the anxieties that are distracting
his own mind: but when she claims to share them as the privilege and
pledge of wifehood, with his quick sympathy he sees it at once:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You are my true and honourable wife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As dear to me as are the ruddy drops</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That visit my sad heart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 288.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And yielding to her claim as a right, he
recognises that it is a claim that comes from an ideally noble
and loving soul, and prays to be made worthy of her. What insight
Shakespeare shows even in his omissions! This is the prayer of
Plutarch’s Brutus too, but he lifts up his hands and beseeches the gods
that he may “bring his enterprise to so goode passe that he mighte be
founde a husband worthie of so noble a wife as Porcia.” Shakespeare’s
Brutus does not view his worthiness as connected with any material success.</p>

<p>And these words are also an evidence of his humble-mindedness. However
aggressive and overbearing he may appear in certain relations, we
never fail to see his essential modesty. If he interferes, as often
enough he does, to bow others to his will, it is not because he is
self-conceited, but because he is convinced that a particular course
is right; and where right is concerned, a man must come forward to
enforce it. But for himself he has no idea of the high estimation in
which his character and parts are held. When Cassius insinuates that
everyone thinks him the man for the emergency, if he would only realise
it, his reply is a disclaimer: he has never supposed, and shrinks from
imagining, that he is fit for such a role. Yet such is his personality
that, as all of the faction feel, his help is absolutely necessary if
the conspiracy is to have a chance of approval. Cinna exhorts Cassius
to win him to the party, Casca bears witness to his popular credit and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
to the value of his sanction in recommending the enterprise, Ligarius
is willing to follow any course if Brutus leads, the cynical Cassius
admits his worth and their great need of him.</p>

<p>For his amiable and attractive virtues are saved from all taint of
weakness by an heroic strain, both high-spirited and public-spirited,
both stoical and chivalrous. Challenged by the solicitations of Cassius
he for once breaks through his reticence, and discloses his inward
temper. We may be sure that even then he speaks less than he feels.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If it be aught toward the general good,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Set honour in one eye, and death i’ the other,</div>

    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 85.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This elevated way of thinking has been fostered
and confirmed by study, just as in the case of Sidney, and by study of
much the same kind. Plutarch says:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> Now touching the Greecian Philosophers, there was
no sect nor Philosopher of them, but he heard and liked it: but above
all the rest, he loved Platoes sect best, and did not much give himself
to the new or meane Academy as they call it, but altogether to the old
Academy. </p>

<p>He has striven to direct his life by right reason, and has pondered its
problems under the guidance of his chosen masters. His utterance, which
Plutarch quotes, on suicide, shows how he has sought Plato’s aid for a
standard by which to judge others and himself.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> His utterance, which
Shakespeare invents, on the death of Portia, shows how he has schooled

He is essentially a thinker, a reader, a student. Plutarch had told
how on the eve of Pharsalia, when his companions were resting, or
forecasting the morrow, Brutus “fell to his booke and wrote all day long
till night, wryting a breviarie of Polybius.” And in his last campaign:</p>

<p class="blockquot">His heade ever busily occupied to thinke of his
affayres, ... after he had slumbered a little after supper, he spent
all the rest of the night in dispatching of his waightiest causes, and
after he had taken order for them, if he had any leysure left him,
he would read some booke till the third watch of the night, at what
tyme the Captaines, pety Captaines and Colonells, did use to come unto
him.</p>

<p>Shakespeare only visualises this description when he makes him find the
book, that in his troubles and griefs he has been “seeking for so,”
in the pocket of his gown, with the leaf turned down where he stopped
reading.</p>

<p>Does then Shakespeare take over Plutarch’s favourite, merely removing
the single stain and accenting all the attractions, to confront him as
the embodiment of republican virtue, with Caesar, against whom too no
evil is remembered, as the embodiment of imperial majesty? Will he show
the inevitable collision between two political principles each worthily
represented in its respective champion?</p>

<p>This has been said, and there are not wanting arguments to support it.
It is clear that the contrast is not perplexed by side issues. Brutus
has no quarrel with Caesar as a man, and no justification is given for
the conspiracy in what Caesar has done. On the contrary, his murderer
stands sponsor for his character, acknowledges his supreme greatness,
and loves him as a dear friend. But neither on the other hand is
anything introduced that might divert our sympathies from Brutus by
representing him as bound by other than the voluntary ties of affection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
and respect. And this is the more remarkable that in Plutarch there
are two particulars full of personal pathos which Shakespeare cannot
have failed to note, and which lend themselves to dramatic purposes, as
other dramatists have proved. One of them, employed by Voltaire, would
darken the assassination to parricide. In explanation of the indulgence
with which Caesar treated Brutus, Plutarch says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">When he was a young man, he had been acquainted
with Servilia, who was extreamelie in love with him. And bicause Brutus
was borne in that time when their love was hottest, he perswaded him
selfe that he begat him.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">And then follows what can be alleged in proof.
“What of anguish,” says Mr. Wyndham, “does this not add to the sweep
of the gesture wherewith the hero covered his face from the pedant’s
sword!”</p>

<p>This is a mere casual hint; but the other point finds repeated mention
in the <i>Life</i>, and is dwelt upon though explained away in the
<i>Comparison</i>. It is the circumstance that Brutus had fought on
Pompey’s side, and that thereafter Caesar had spared him, amnestied his
friends, and loaded him with favours.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The greatest reproache they could make against
Brutus was: that Julius Caesar having saved his life, and pardoned all
the prisoners also taken in battell, as many as he made request for,
taking him for his frende, and honoring him above all his other frends,
Brutus notwithstanding had imbrued his hands in his
blood.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">Plutarch indeed instances this as the grand proof
of Brutus’ superiority to personal considerations; but it looks bad,
and certainly introduces a new element into the moral problem. At all
events, though it involves in a specially acute form that conflict of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
duties which the drama loves, and was so used by Shakespeare’s
contemporaries, as early as Muretus and as late as Alexander,
Shakespeare dismisses it.</p>

<p>Attention is concentrated on the single fact that Brutus felt it his
duty to take the life of Caesar, and no obligations of kinship or
gratitude are allowed to complicate the one simple case of conscience.</p>

<p>The victim and the sacrificer are thus set before us, each with an
unstained record, and in only those personal relations that arise from
warm and reverent friendship.</p>

<p>Of their mutual attachment we are left in no doubt, nor are we ever
suffered to forget it. Cassius in talk to himself, bears witness that
Caesar “loves Brutus” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 317). Antony, in his speech to
the people, appeals to this as a notorious fact:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Judge, O you Gods, how dearly Caesar loved him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 185.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the strongest testimony is Caesar’s own cry,
the cry of astonishment and consternation, whether from the betrayed
when the beloved is the traitor, or from the condemned when the beloved
is the judge:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Et tu Brute! Then fall, Caesar!</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 77.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Nor is less stress laid on Brutus’ feeling. He
avows it in the Forum, as before he had assured Antony that “he did
love Caesar when he struck him” (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> i.
182). Cassius tells him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 106.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But here again the most pathetic evidence is to
be found in the assassination scene itself. When Brutus stoops in the
guise of petitioner, we cannot suppose it is merely with treacherous
adroitness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 52.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Knowing the man, do we not feel that this is the
last tender farewell?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
But though all this is true it cannot be maintained, in view of the
soliloquy before the conspirators’ meeting, that Shakespeare makes
Brutus the mouthpiece of republicanism, as he makes Caesar the
mouthpiece of imperialism. The opposition of principles is present,
but it is of principles on a different plane.</p>

<p>Caesar, the spirit of Caesar, is indeed the spirit of Empire,
the spirit of practical greatness in the domains of war, policy,
organisation: of this he is the exponent, to this he is the martyr.
Brutus’ spirit is rather the spirit of loyalty to duty, which finds in
him its exponent and martyr too.</p>

<p>He is lavishly endowed by nature with all the inward qualities that
go to make the virtuous man, and these he has improved and disciplined
by every means in his power. His standard is high, but he is so
strenuous and sincere in living up to it, that he is recognised as no
less pre-eminent in the sphere of ethics, than Caesar in the sphere
of politics. Indeed their different ideals dominate and impel both
men in an almost equal degree. And in each case this leads to a kind
of pose. It appears even in their speech. The balanced precision of
the one tells its own tale as clearly as the overstrained loftiness
of the other, and is as closely matched with the part that he needs
must play. Obviously Brutus does not like to confess that he has been
in the wrong. No more in the σώφρων than in the Emperor is there room
for any weakness. After his dispute with Cassius he assumes rather
unjustifiably that he has on the whole been in the right, that he has
been the provoked party, and that at worst he has shown momentary heat.
But even this slight admission, coming from him, fills Cassius with
surprise.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent1"><i>Brutus.</i> When I spoke that, I was ill-temper’d too.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Cassius.</i> Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent34">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 116.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
The Ideal Wise Man must not yield to anger any more than to other
passions, and it costs Brutus something to own that he has done so. But
he minimises his confession by accepting Cassius’ apology for his rash
humour and promising to overlook any future offences, as though none
could be laid to his own door. We like him none the worse for this, his
cult of perfection is so genuine: but sometimes the cult of perfection
becomes the assumption and obtrusion of it. Read the passage where
Messala tells him of Portia’s death.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Messala.</i> Had you letters from your wife, my lord?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> No, Messala.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Messala.</i> Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> Nothing, Messala.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Messala.</i><span class="ws7">That, methinks, is strange.</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Messala.</i> No. my lord.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Messala.</i> Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i> Why, farewell, Portia.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 181.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Now Brutus had received earlier tidings. He may
profess ignorance to save himself the pain of explanation, though
surely it would have been simpler to say, “I know all.” But the
effect is undoubtedly to bring his self-control into fuller relief in
presence of Messala and Titinius even than in the presence of Cassius
a few minutes before; for then he was announcing what he already knew,
here he would seem in the eyes of his informants to be encountering
the first shock. Too much must not be made of this, for Cassius who
is aware of the circumstances, is no less impressed than the others,
and Cassius would have detected any hollow ring. But at the least it
savours of a willingness to give a demonstration, so to speak, in
Clinical Ethics.</p>

<p>A man like this whose desires are set on building up a virtuous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
character, but who is not free from the self-consciousness and
self-confidence of the specialist in virtue, is exposed to peculiar
dangers. His interests and equipment are in the first place for the
inward life, and his chief concern is the well-being of his soul. But
precisely such an one knows that he cannot save his own soul alone. It
is not open to him to disregard the claims of his fellows or the needs
of the world, so he is driven to take in hand matters for which he has
no inclination or aptitude. He may be quite aware of his unfitness for
the work and shrink from investing himself with qualities which he
knows he does not possess. All the same, if the call comes, the logic
of his nature will force him to essay the ungrateful and impossible
task; and he will be apt to imagine a call when there is none. So it
is with Brutus. It is true that many of the best respect do look up
to him and designate him as their leader: it is none the less true
that the unsigned instigations which he takes for the voice of Rome,
are the fabrications of a single schemer. He would not be Brutus
if he suspected or shirked the summons. This votary of duty cannot
acknowledge a merely fugitive and cloistered virtue; this platonic
theorist can easily be hood-winked by the practised politician. So
Brutus, who is so at home in his study with his book, who is so
exemplary in all the private relations of friend, master and husband;
predestined, one would say, for the serene labours of philosophic
thought and the gracious offices of domestic affection, sweeps from his
quiet anchorage to face the storms of political strife, which such as
he are not born to master but which they think they must not avoid.</p>

<p>It is a common case; and many have by their very conscientiousness
been hurried into a false position where they could not escape from
committing blunders and incurring guilt. But generally the blunders are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
corrigible and the guilt is venial. It is Brutus’ misfortune, that his
very greatness, his moral ascendancy with the prestige it bestows,
gives him the foremost place, and shifts on his shoulders the main
responsibility for all the folly and crime.</p>

<p>For it is inevitable that he should proceed as he does. Yet it is not
easy for him. There is a conflict in this sensitive and finely tuned
spirit, which, with all his acquired fortitude, bewrays itself in his
bearing to Cassius before any foreign suggestion has entered his mind,
which afterwards makes him unlike himself in his behaviour to his wife,
which drives sleep from his eyes for nights together, which so jars
the rare harmony of his nature, in Antony’s view his chief perfection,
that he seems to suffer from an insurrection within himself. And it
is not hard to understand why this should be. Morality is the guiding
principle of Brutus’ character, but what if it should be at variance
with itself? Now two sets of moral forces are at strife in his heart.
There are the more personal sentiments of love and reverence for Caesar
and of detestation for the crime he contemplates. Even after his
decision he feels the full horror of conspiracy with its “monstrous
visage”; how much more must he feel the horror of assassinating a
friend! On the other side are the more traditional ethical obligations
to state, class, and house. It is almost as fatal to this visionary
to be called Brutus, as it is to the poet to be called Cinna. For a
great historic name spares its bearer a narrow margin of liberty. It
should be impossible for a Bourbon to be other than a legitimist; it
would be impossible for a Romanoff to abandon the Orthodox Church; it
is impossible for a Brutus to accept the merest show of royal power.
The memory of his stock is about him. Now Cassius reminds him of his
namesake who would brook the eternal devil in Rome as easily as a king;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
now the admonition is affixed with wax upon Old Brutus’ statue; now he
himself recalls the share his ancestors had in expelling the Tarquin.
If such an one acquiesced in the coronation of Caesar, he must be the
basest renegade, or more detached from his antecedents than it is given
a mortal man to be. And in Brutus there is no hint of such detachment.
The temper that makes him so attentive and loyal to the pieties of
life, is the very temper that vibrates to all that is best in the past,
and clings to the spirit of use-and-wont. Let it again be repeated
that Brutus reveals himself to Shakespeare very much in the form of a
cultured and high-souled English nobleman, the heir of great traditions
and their responsibilities, which he fulfils to the smallest jot and
tittle; the heir also of inevitable preconceptions.</p>

<p>But in Brutus there is more than individual morality and inherited
ethos: there is superimposed on these the conscious philosophic theory
with which his actions must be squared. He has to determine his conduct
not by instinct or usage, but by impersonal, unprejudiced reason. It
is to this tribunal that in the last resort he must appeal; and in
that strange soliloquy of his he puts aside all private preferences on
the one hand, all local considerations on the other, and discusses his
difficulty quite as an abstract problem of right and wrong. He sees
that if the personal rule of Caesar is to be averted, half measures
will not suffice. There are no safeguards or impediments that can
prevent the supremacy of so great a man if he is allowed to live. This
is his starting point: “It must be by his death.” But then the question
arises: is the death of such an one permissible? And in answering
it Brutus seems at the first glance to show admirable intellectual
candour. He acquits Caesar of all blame; the quarrel “will bear no
colour for the thing he is.” What could be more dispassionate and
impartial, what more becoming the philosopher? There is no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
sophistication of the facts in the interest of his party. But
immediately there follow the incriminating words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would run to these and these extremities.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 30.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There is a sophistication of the inference. Surely
this line of argument is invented to support a foregone conclusion.
Already that hint to his conscience, “Fashion it thus,” betrays the
resolve to make out a case. And does the mere future contingency
justify the present infliction of death? Brutus is appealing to his
philosophy: by his philosophy he is judged: for just about this date he
was condemning the suicide of Cato because he found it</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent17">Cowardly and vile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>For fear of what might fall</i>, so to prevent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The time of life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 104.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the argument is the same in both cases, and if
it does not excuse self-murder, still less does it excuse the murder of
others.</p>

<p>The truth is that Brutus, though he personates the philosopher, is less
of one than he thinks. It is not his philosophy but his character that
gives him strength to bear the grief of Portia’s death; as Cassius says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I have as much of this in art as you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But yet my nature could not bear it so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 194.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">At the end he casts his philosophy to the winds
rather than go bound to Rome: he “bears too great a mind”
(<span class="allsmcap">v.</span> i. 113). And just as on these occasions
he is independent or regardless of it, so here he tampers with it to
get the verdict that is required. For even in his own eyes he has to
play the part of the ideally wise and virtuous man; and though the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
obligations of descent and position, the consideration in which he is
held, the urgings of a malcontent, and (as he believes not altogether
without reason) the expectations formed of him by his fellow citizens,
supply his real motives for the murder, he needs to give it the form of
ideal virtue and wisdom before he can proceed to it.</p>

<p>Now, however, he persuades himself that he has the sanction of reason
and conscience, and he acts on the persuasion. His hesitations are
gone. He can face without wincing the horror of conspiracy. With an
impassioned eloquence, which he nowhere else displays, he can lift the
others to the level of his own views. No doubts or scruples becloud his
enthusiasm now.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">If not the face of men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And every man hence to his idle bed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So let high-sighted tyranny range on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till each man drop by lottery.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 114.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">His certainty has advanced by leaps and bounds. A
few minutes ago there was no complaint against Caesar as he was or had
been, but it could be alleged that he might or would change: now his
tyranny, lighting by caprice on men, is announced as a positive fact of
the future or even of the present. But by this time Brutus is assured
that the plot is just and that the confederates are the pick of men,
both plot and confederates so noble that for them an ordinary pledge
would be an insult:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Unto bad causes swear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such creatures as men doubt: but do not stain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The even virtue of our enterprise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor the insuppressive metal of our spirits,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To think that or our cause or our performance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did need an oath.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 132.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He carries them away with him. They abandon the
oath; they accept all his suggestions; we feel that their thoughts are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
ennobled by his intervention, that, as Plutarch noted to be the effect
of his fellowship, he has made them better men, at least for the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it is a devout imagination, an unconscious sophistry that
lends him his power; and this brings its own Nemesis at its heels. In
the future Brutus will be disillusioned of the merit of the exploit. In
the present, persuading his associates of its unparalleled glory, he
makes them take their measures to suit. He will not hear of the murder
of Antony, for that would be bloody and unnecessary. And his clemency
is based on disparagement of Antony’s abilities and contempt for his
moral character. Of this “limb of Caesar,” as he calls him, “who can do
no more than Caesar’s arm when Caesar’s head is off,” he cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he love Caesar, all that he can do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that were much he should; for he is given</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To sports, to wildness and much company.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 185.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is not so in Plutarch:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Brutus would not agree to it. First for that he
sayd it was not honest: secondly, bicause he told them there was hope
of chaunge in him. For he did not mistrust, but that Antonius being a
noble minded and coragious man (when he should knowe that Caesar was
dead) would willingly helpe his contrie to recover her libertie, having
them an example unto him to follow their corage and vertue.</p>

<p>In this hope of converting a <i>rusé</i> libertine like Antony, there
is no doubt a hint of idealism, but it is not so marked as in the
high-pitched magnanimity of Shakespeare’s Brutus, who denies a man’s
powers of mischief because his life is loose.</p>

<p>Yet though Antony would always be a source of danger, the conspirators
might find compensation in the reputation for leniency they would gain,
and the danger might be reduced were effective steps taken to render him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
innocuous. But this is only the beginning of Brutus’ mistakes. If
indeed they had not begun before. With his masterful influence he has
dissuaded his friends from applying to Cicero, on the ground that
Cicero will not share in any scheme of which he is not the author. It
may be so, but one would think it was at least an experiment well worth
the trying. Apart from the authority of his years and position, there
would have been the spell of his oratory; and of that they were soon
to be sorely in need, again through Brutus’ crotchet that their course
evinced its own virtue, and that virtue was a sufficient defence.</p>

<p class="blockquot">“The first fault that he did,” says Plutarch,
“was, when he would not consent to his fellow conspirators, that Antony
should be slayne: and therefore he was justly accused, that thereby he
had saved a stronge and grievous enemy of their conspiracy. The second
fault was when he agreed that Caesars funeralls should be as Antony
would have them: the which in deede marred all.”</p>

<p>This hint Shakespeare works out. He sees clearly that this further
blunder marred all, and heightens the folly of it in various ways. For
in Plutarch the question is debated in the Senate, after it has been
determined that the assassins shall be not only pardoned but honoured
and after provinces have been assigned to them, Crete to Brutus, Africa
to Cassius, and the like. Only then, when their victory seems complete
and assured, do they discuss the obsequies.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Antonius thinking good his testament should be red
openly, and also that his body should be honorably buried, and not in
hugger mugger, least the people might thereby take occasion to be worse
offended if they did otherwise: Cassius stowtly spake against it. But
Brutus went with the motion and agreed unto it.</p>

<p>That is the amount of his error: that when all seemed to be going well
with the faction, Antony, who had shown himself in seeming and for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
time their most influential friend, commended the proposal on
opportunist grounds, and Cassius opposed it, but Brutus supported
it and voted with the majority. In the Play his responsibility is
undivided, and all the explanatory circumstances have disappeared. He
is not one member of an approving Senate, who, when the assassination
seems once for all a <i>chose jugée</i>, accepts a suggestion, made
apparently in the interests of peace and quiet, by the man to whom,
more than to anyone else, the settlement of the affair is due. While
the position is still critical, without any evidence of Antony’s good
will, without any pressure of public opinion or any plea of political
expediency, he endows the helpless suppliant with means to undo what
has been done and destroy those who have done it. No wonder that
Cassius when he hears Brutus giving Antony permission to speak in the
market place, interrupts: “Brutus, a word with you,” and continues in
the alarmed aside:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You know not what you do: do not consent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Antony speak in his funeral:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Know you how much the people may be moved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By that which he will utter?</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 232.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But Brutus waves his remonstrance aside. He is
now so besotted by his own sophisms that he will listen to no warning.
He thinks all risk will be averted by his going into the pulpit first
to show the “reason” of Caesar’s death. He has quite forgotten that
the one reason that he could allege to himself was merely a hazardous
conclusion from doubtful premises; and this forsooth is to satisfy the
citizens of Rome. But meanwhile since their deed is so irreproachable
and disinterested, the conspirators must act in accordance, and show
their freedom from any personal motive by giving Caesar all due rites:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
The infatuation is almost incredible, and it springs not only from
generosity to Antony and Caesar, but from the fatal assumption of the
justice of his cause, and the Quixotic exaltation the assumption brings
with it.</p>

<p>For were it ever so just, could this be brought home to the Roman
populace? Brutus, who is never an expert in facts, has been misled
by the inventions of Cassius, which he mistakes for the general
voice of Rome. Here, too, Shakespeare departs from his authority to
make the duping of his hero more conspicuous. For in Plutarch these
communications are the quite spontaneous incitements of the public, not
the contrivances of one dissatisfied aristocrat.</p>

<p class="blockquot">But for Brutus, <i>his frendes and contrie
men</i>, both by divers procurementes, and sundrie rumors of the citie,
and by many bills also, did openlie call and procure him to doe that he
did. For, under the image of his auncestor Junius Brutus, that drave
the kinges out of Rome, they wrote: “O, that it had pleased the goddes
that thou wert now alive, Brutus: and againe that thou wert with us
nowe.” His tribunall (or chaire) where he gave audience during the time
he was praetor, was full of such billes: “Brutus, thou art a sleepe,
and art not Brutus in deede.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">All these in Plutarch are worth their face
value, but in Shakespeare they are not: and it is one of the ironies
of Brutus’ career that he takes them as appeals from the people when
they are only the juggleries of Cassius. So far from objecting to
Imperialism, the citizens when most favourable to Brutus call out,
“Let him be Caesar!” “Caesar’s better parts shall be crowned in Brutus”
(<span class="smcap">iii.</span> ii. 56). This is the acme of his
success and the prologue to his disillusionment.</p>

<p>But even if the case of the conspirators could be commended to the
populace, Brutus is not the man to do it. It is comic and pathetic to
hear him reassuring Cassius with the promise to speak first as though he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
could neutralise in advance the arts of Antony. Compare his oration
with that of his rival. First, in the matter of it, there is no appeal
to the imagination or passions, but an unvarnished series of arguments
addressed exclusively to the logical reason. Such a speech would make
little impression on an assembly of those who are called educated men,
and to convince an audience like the artisans of Rome (for such was
Shakespeare’s conception of the People), it is ridiculously inadequate.
But the style is no less out of place. The diction is as different as
possible from the free and fluent rhetoric of Antony. Shakespeare had
read in Plutarch:</p>

<p class="blockquot">They do note in some of his Epistells, that
he counterfeated that briefe compendious maner of speach of the
Lacedaemonians. As when the warre was begonne, he wrote unto the
Pergamenians in this sorte: “I understand you have geven Dolabella
money; if you have done it willingly, you confesse you have offended
me: if against your wills, shewe it then by geving me willinglie.”
An other time againe unto the Samians: “Your counsels be long, your
doinges be slowe, consider the ende.” And in an other Epistell he wrote
unto<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
the Patareians: “The Xanthians despising my good wil, have made
their contrie a grave of dispaire: and the Patareians that put them
selves into my protection, have lost no jot of their libertie. And
therefore whilest you have libertie, either choose the judgement of the
Patareians, or the fortune of the Xanthians.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">Thus prompted Shakespeare makes Brutus affect the
balanced structure of Euphuism. Not only in his oration. Read his words
to Cassius at their first interview:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What you would work me to, I have some aim;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How I have thought of this and of these times,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be any further moved. What you have said</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will consider: what you have to say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will with patience hear, and find a time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 161.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Nothing could be more neat, accurate and
artificial than this Euphuistic arrangement of phrases. It at once
suggests the academic studious quality of Brutus’ expression whenever
he gives thought to it. But it is a style unsuitable to, one might
almost say incompatible with, genuine passion. So it is noteworthy
that when he lets himself go in answer to Cassius and introduces the
personal accent, he abandons his mannerisms. And could the symmetrical
clauses of his oration move the popular heart? It has a noble ring
about it, because it is sincere, with the reticence and sobriety
which the sincere man is careful to observe when he is advocating his
own case. But that is not the sort of thing that the Saviour of his
Country, as Brutus thought himself to be, will find fit to sway a mob.
Nevertheless his eloquence was notorious. Plutarch states that when his
mind “was moved to followe any matter, he used a kind of forcible and
vehement perswasion that calmed not till he had obteyned his desire.”
There is a rush of emotion in his words when he is denouncing the
conventional pledge or wanton bloodshed, but if any personal interest
is involved, the springs are dry. In the Forum it is characteristic
that he speaks with far more warmth—a transition indicated not only by
the change of style, but, after Shakespeare’s wont, by the substitution
of verse for prose—when he no longer pleads for himself but tries to
get a hearing for Mark Antony.</p>

<p>And this is the man with his formal dialectic and professorial oratory,
impassioned only on behalf of his enemy, who thinks that by a temperate
statement of the course which he has seduced his reason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
to approve, he can prevent the perils of a speech by Caesar’s friend.
He does not even wait to hear it: but if he did, what could he effect
against the sophistries and rhetorical tricks, the fervour and regret,
the gesticulation and tears of Antony’s headlong improvisation?</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE DISILLUSIONMENT OF BRUTUS.<br /> PORTIA</span></h3>

</div>

<p>Brutus had been doubly duped, by his own subtlety and his own
simplicity in league with his conscientiousness; for in this way he
was led to idealise his deed as enjoined both by the inward moral code
and the demands of his country, and such self-deception avenges itself
as surely as any intentional crime. He is soon disabused in regard to
the wishes of Rome and its view of the alleged wrongs it has suffered
from Caesar. His imagination had dwelt on the time when his ancestors
drove out the Tarquin; now he himself must ride “like a madman” through
the gates. It is not only the first of his reverses but a step towards
his enlightenment, for it helps to show that he has been mistaken in
the people. Still, the momentary mood of the populace may not always
recognise its best interests and real needs, and may not coincide with
the true <i>volonté générale</i>. There is harder than this in store
for Brutus. By the time we meet him again at Sardis a worse punishment
has overtaken him, and his education in disappointment has advanced,
though he does his utmost to treat the punishment as fate and not to
learn the lessons it enforces.</p>

<p>This scene has won the applause of the most dissimilar minds and
generations. We have seen how Leonard Digges singles it out as the grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
attraction of the play, by which, above all others, it transcends the
laboured excellences of <i>Catiline</i> or <i>Sejanus</i>. It excited
the admiration and rivalry of the greatest genius of the Restoration
period. Scott says of the dispute between Antony and Ventidius in
<i>All for Love</i>: “Dryden when writing this scene had unquestionably
in his recollection the quarrel between Brutus and Cassius, which was
so justly a favourite in his time, and to which he had referred as
inimitable in his prologue to <i>Aureng-Zebe</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But spite of all his pride, a secret shame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Invades his breast at Shakespeare’s sacred name:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Awed, when he hears his godlike Romans rage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He in a just despair would quit the stage;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to an age less polished, more unskilled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Does with disdain the foremost honours yield.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In the eighteenth century Dr. Johnson, though he finds
<i>Julius Caesar</i> as a whole “somewhat cold and unaffecting,” perhaps
because Shakespeare’s “adherence to the real story and to Roman manners”
has “impeded the natural vigour of his genius,” excepts particular passages
and cites “the contention and reconciliation of Brutus and Cassius”
as universally celebrated. And Coleridge goes beyond himself in his
praise: “I know no part of Shakespeare that more impresses on me the
belief of his being superhuman, than this scene between Brutus and
Cassius. In the Gnostic heresy it might have been credited with less
absurdity than most of their dogmas, that the Supreme had employed him
to create, previously to his function of representing characters.”
Yet it is not merely in the revelation of character that the scene is
unique. More than any other single episode, more than all the rest
together, it lays bare the significance of the story in its tragic
pathos and its tragic irony. And the wonder of it is increased rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
than lessened when we take note that it is a creation not out of
nothing but out of chaos. For there is hardly a suggestion, hardly a
detail, that Shakespeare did not find in Plutarch, but here in confused
mixture, there in inert isolation, and nowhere with more than the
possibilities of being organised. It is Shakespeare, who, to borrow
from Milton’s description of the beginning of his Universe, “founded
and conglobed like things to like, and vital virtue infused and vital
warmth.”</p>

<p>The nucleus of this passage is found just after the account of Brutus’
exploits in Lycia.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>About that tyme, Brutus sent to pray Cassius to come to the citye of
Sardis, and so he did. Brutus understanding of his comming, went out to
meete him with all his frendes. There both their armies being armed,
they called them both Emperors. Nowe, as it commonly hapneth in great
affayres betwene two persons, both of them having many friends, and so
many Captaines under them; there ranne tales and complaints betwixt
them. Therefore, before they fell in hand with any other matter, they
went into a little chamber together, and bad every man avoyde, and did
shut the dores to them. Then they beganne to powre out their complaints
one to the other, and grew hot and lowde, earnestly accusing one
another, and at length fell both a weeping. Their friends that were
without the chamber hearing them lowde within, and angry betwene them
selves, they were both amased and affrayd also lest it would grow to
further matter: but yet they were commaunded that no man should come
to them. Notwithstanding, one Marcus Phaonius, that had bene a friend
and follower of Cato while he lived, and tooke upon him to counterfeate
a Philosopher, not with wisedom and discretion, but with a certaine
bedlem and frantick motion: he would needes come into the chamber,
though the men offered to keepe him out. But it was no boote to let
Phaonius, when a mad moode or toy tooke him in the head: for he was a
hot hasty man, and sodaine in all his doings, and cared for never a
Senator of them all. Now, though he used this bold manner of speeche
after the profession of the Cynick Philosophers (as who would say,
doggs), yet this boldnes did no hurt many times, bicause they did but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
laugh at him to see him so mad. This Phaonius at that time, in despite
of the doore keepers, came into the chamber, and with a certain
scoffing and mocking gesture which he counterfeated of purpose, he
rehearsed the verses which old Nestor sayd in Homer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My lords, I pray you harken both to mee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I have seene moe yeares than suchye three.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Cassius fell a-laughing at him: but Brutus thrust him out of the
chamber, and called him dogge, and counterfeate Cynick. Howbeit his
comming in brake their strife at that time, and so they left eche other.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here there seems little enough to tempt the
dramatist; the two generals quarrel, Phaonius bursts in, Cassius
laughs at him, Brutus turns him out, but the interruption temporarily
patches up a truce between them. And this petty incident is made the
most pregnant in Shakespeare’s whole play; and that by apparently such
simple means. To get the meaning out of it, or to read the meaning
into it, he does little more, so far as the mechanical aspects of his
treatment are concerned, than collect a few other notices scattered
up and down the pages of his authority. He had found in an earlier
digression Cassius described as</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">a hot cholerick and cruell man, that
would often tymes be caried away from justice for gayne: it was
certainly thought that he made warre, and put him selfe into sundry
daungers, more to have absolute power and authoritie, than to defend
the liberty of his contrie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Again after describing Brutus’ success with the
Patareians, Plutarch proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cassius, about the selfe same tyme, after he
had compelled the Rhodians every man to deliver all the ready money
they had in gold and silver in their houses, the which being brought
together, amounted to the summe of eyght thousande talents: yet he
condemned the citie besides, to paye the summe of five hundred talents
more. When Brutus in contrary manner, after he had leavyed of all the
contrye of Lycia but a hundred and fiftye talents onely: he departed
thence into the contrye of Ionia, and did them no more hurt.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Previously with reference to the first meeting of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
the fugitives after they collected their armies and before they came
to Sardis at all, Plutarch narrates:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Whilst Brutus and Cassius were together in the
citie of Smyrna: Brutus prayed Cassius to let him have some part of
his money whereof he had great store, bicause all that he could rappe
and rend of his side, he had bestowed it in making so great a number
of shippes, that by meanes of them they should keepe all the sea at
their commaundement. Cassius’ friendes hindered this request, and
earnestly disswaded him from it: perswading him, that it was no reason
that Brutus should have the money which Cassius had gotten together by
sparing, and leavied with great evil will of the people their subjects,
for him to bestowe liberally uppon his souldiers, and by this meanes
to winne their good willes, by Cassius charge. This notwithstanding,
Cassius gave him the third part of his totall summe.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Then at Sardis, but not on occasion of the dispute
interrupted by Phaonius, mention is made of the affair with Pella:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The next daye after, Brutus, upon complaynt of
the Sardians did condemne and noted Lucius Pella for a defamed person,
that had been a Praetor of the Romanes, and whome Brutus had given
charge unto: for that he was accused and convicted of robberie, and
pilferie in his office. This judgement much misliked Cassius; bicause
he him selfe had secretly (not many dayes before) warned two of his
friends, attainted and convicted of the like offences, and openly had
cleered them: but yet he did not therefore leave to employ them in any
manner of service as he did before. And therefore he greatly reproved
Brutus, for that he would shew him selfe so straight and seveare in
such a tyme, as was meeter to beare a little, then to take thinges at
the worst. Brutus in contrary manner aunswered, that he should remember
the Ides of Marche, at which tyme they slue Julius Caesar: who nether
pilled nor polled the contrye, but onely was a favorer and suborner of
all them that did robbe and spoyle, by his countenaunce and authoritie.
And if there were any occasion whereby they might honestly sette aside
justice and equitie: they should have had more reason to have suffered
Caesar’s friendes, to have robbed and done what wronge and injurie they
had would, then to beare with their owne men. For then, sayde he, they
could but have sayde they had bene cowards: “and now they may accuse
us of injustice, beside the paynes we take, and the daunger we put our
selves into.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
Lastly at the end of the <i>Life of Brutus</i>, Shakespeare would find
a short notice of the death of Portia. No indication is given of the
date at which this took place, except that Plutarch seems on the whole
to discredit the idea that she survived her husband.</p>

<p class="blockquot">And for Porcia, Brutus’ wife: Nicolaus the
Philosopher, and Valerius Maximus doe wryte, that she determining to
kill her selfe (her parents and frendes carefullie looking to her to
kepe her from it) tooke hot burning coles, and cast them into her
mouth, and kept her mouth so close, that she choked her selfe. There
was a letter of Brutus found wrytten to his frendes, complayning of
their negligence, that his wife being sicke, they would not helpe
her, but suffered her to kill her selfe, choosing to dye rather than
to languish in paine. Thus it appeareth, that Nicolaus knewe not well
that time, sith the letter (at the least if it were Brutus letter) doth
plainly declare the disease and love of this Lady, as also the maner of
her death.</p>

<p>Now in Shakespeare’s scene all these detached jottings find their
predestined place, and together have an accumulated import of which
Plutarch has only the remotest guess. They are so combined as to
bring out at once the ideal aspect of Brutus’ deed, and its folly and
disastrousness in view of the facts. He maintains his manhood under the
most terrible ordeal, which is well; he clings to his illusion in the
face of the clearest proof, which is not so well. He is gathering evil
fruit where he looked for good, but he refuses to admit that the tree
was corrupt; and of the prestige that his clear conscience confers, he
still makes baneful use. He is raised to the heroic by his persistence
in regarding the murder as an act of pure and disinterested justice,
but for that very reason he makes his blunders, and puts himself and
others in the wrong.</p>

<p>Perhaps indeed his loss of temper is to be ascribed to another cause.
He is in a tense, over-wrought state, when the slightest thing will
provoke an outbreak. In Cassius’ view his private and personal sorrow,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
the only one Cassius could understand, might quite well, apart from all
the rest, have driven him to greater violence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">How ’scaped I killing when I cross’d you so?</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 150.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>No wonder he uses stinging words to his friend, taxes him most unfairly
with the boast of being a better soldier, and flings aside Cassius’
temperate correction of “elder,” with the contemptuous, “If you did,
I care not.” No wonder he drives out the poet, while Cassius merely
laughs at him. Yet even here, though he is undoubtedly the angrier and
more unreasonable in the quarrel, his moral dignity just before has
saved him from an indiscretion into which Cassius falls. When the other
begins to complain before the soldiers, Brutus checks him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Cassius, be content;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speak your griefs softly; I do know you well.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the eyes of both our armies here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which should perceive nothing but love from us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let us not wrangle: Bid them move away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I will give you audience.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii. 41.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In the onset of misfortune Brutus does not
forget his weightier responsibilities, though the strain of resisting
it may impair his suavity. The fine balance of his nature that was
overthrown by suspense, may well be shaken by his afflictions. For they
are more numerous than Cassius knew and more poignant than he could
understand.</p>

<p>Portia’s suicide with all its terrible accessories Brutus brings into
relation with himself. It is absence from him, and, as his love tells
him, distress at the growing power of his enemies that caused her
madness. The ruin of that home life which was his native element, the
agony and death of the wife he worshipped, are the direct consequences
of his own act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
And with this private there has come also the public news. The
proscription has already swept away seventy senators; Cicero, despite
his “silver hairs,” his “judgment,” and his “gravity” being one; and
the number given, according to Messala, is an understatement. Brutus
had talked of each man’s dropping by lottery under Caesar’s rule, but
however much Caesar had degenerated, would he have decreed a more
wholesale and indiscriminate slaughter than this? Was there anything
in his career as described by Brutus himself, that foreshadowed a
callousness like that of the Triumvirs in pricking down and damning
their victims, among them the most illustrious members of Brutus’ own
class? And the perpetrators, far from injuring their cause by these
atrocities, are in a position to take the field with a “mighty power.”
So the civil war with all its horrors and miseries will run its full course.</p>

<p>But even that is not the worst. Brutus has to realise that his
associates were not the men he supposed them. Their hands are not
clean, their hearts are not pure, even his brother Cassius connives
at corruption and has “an itching palm” himself. Even when the <i>soi
disant</i> deliverers wield the power, what are things better than they
would have been under Caesar who was at least personally free from such
reproach and whose greatness entitled him to his place in front? Surely
there are few more pathetic passages even in Shakespeare than the
confession of disillusionment wrung from Brutus by the force of events,
a confession none the less significant that he admits disillusion only
as to the results and still clings to his estimate of the deed itself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It has come to this. In anticipating the effects
of Caesar’s rule, he had said he “had rather be a villager than to
repute himself a son of Rome” in the probable conditions. But his
attempt at remedy has resulted in a situation even more intolerable.
He would rather be a dog than such Romans as the confederates whom he
sought to put in Caesar’s place are disclosing themselves to be.</p>

<p>It says much for his intrinsic force, that when all these things rise
up in judgment against him, he can still maintain to himself and others
the essential nobility of the deed that has brought about all the woe
and wrong; and without any faint-hearted penitence, continue to insist
that their doings must conform to his conception of what has been done:
that if that conception conflicts with the facts, it is the facts that
must give way. Yet on that very account he is quite impracticable and
perverse, as every enthusiast for abstract justice must be, who lets
himself be seduced into crime on the plea of duty, and yet shapes his
course as though he were not a criminal.</p>

<p>Brutus has brought about an upturn of society by assassinating the one
man who could organize that society. His own motives were honourable,
though not so unimpeachable as he assumed, but they could not change
wrong into right and they could not be taken for granted in others than
himself. Now in the confusions that ensue he finds, to his horror, that
revolutions are not made with rose water, that even champions of virtue
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
have to reckon with base and dirty tools. So he condemns Pella for
bribery. Cassius judges the case better. He sees that Pella is an
efficient and useful officer of whose services he does not wish to be
deprived. He sees that in domestic broils the leaders must not be too
particular about their instruments, that, according to the old proverb,
you must go into the water to catch fish. But Brutus will not go into
the water. He thinks that an assassin should only have Galahads in his
troops. And sometimes his offended virtue becomes even a little absurd.
He is angry with Cassius for not giving him money, but listen to his speech:</p>

    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 69.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>What does all this come to? That the superfine Brutus will not be
guilty of extortion, but that Cassius may: and then Brutus will demand
to share in the proceeds. All this distress and oppression are his
doing, or at least the consequences of his deed, and he would wash his
hands of these inevitable accompaniments. He would do this by using
Cassius as his <i>âme damnée</i> while yet interfering in Cassius’
necessary measures with his moral rebukes.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
This of course is between Cassius and himself, and if Cassius chooses
to submit, it is his own concern. But Brutus plays the Infallible to
such purpose, that, what with his loftiness of view, his earnestness,
and his marvellous fortitude, he obtains an authority over Cassius’
mind that has disastrous results. Though Cassius is both the better
and the elder soldier, he must needs intermeddle with Cassius’ plan of
campaign. Here, as so often, Shakespeare has no warrant for his most
significant touch. Plutarch had said that Cassius, against his will,
was overruled by Brutus to hazard their fortunes in a single battle.
But that was afterwards, at Philippi. There is no hint that Cassius
was opposed to the movement from Sardis to Philippi, and it is on this
invented circumstance that Shakespeare lays most stress. In the play
Brutus, in the teeth of his fellow generals’ disapproval, insists on
their leaving their vantage ground on the hills, chiefly as it appears
because he dislikes the impositions they are compelled to lay on the
people round about:</p>

    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 206.)</div>

<p class="no-indent">and because he has a vague belief that this is
the nick of time;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There is a tide in the affairs of men,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
These are the arguments which he opposes to Cassius’ skilled strategy.
He will not even listen to Cassius’ rejoinder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Cassius.</i><span class="ws5">Hear me, good brother—</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Brutus.</i> Under your pardon:</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 212.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and he runs on. The spiritual dictator carries his
point, as he always does, and as here especially he is bound to do,
when their recent trial of strength has ratified his powers afresh.
Cassius is hypnotised into compliance, “Then, with your will, go on.”
But Brutus is wrong. He is doing the very thing that the Triumvirs
would have him do and dare not hope he will do. Octavius, when he hears
of the movement, exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">It proves not so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The adoption of Brutus’ plan, which he secured in
part through the advantage he had gained in the quarrel, leads directly
to the final catastrophe.</p>

<p>Here then we have the gist of the whole story. The tribulations of
Brutus that ensue on his grand mistake, the wreck of his dearest
affections, the butchery at Rome, the oppression of the provinces,
the appalling discovery that his party is animated by selfish greed
and not by righteous zeal, and that Caesar bore away the palm in
character as well as ability; the dauntless resolution with which
despite his vibrant sensibility he bears up against the rudest blows;
the sustaining consciousness that he himself acted for the best, and
the pathetic imagination even now that the rest must live up to his
standard; the warrant this gives him to complete the outward ruin of
the cause that already is rotten within—all this is brought home to us
in a passage of little more than two hundred lines. It is not merely a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
masterpiece in characterisation; it at once garners the harvest of the
past and sows the seeds of the future. Nor is the execution inferior
to the conception; the passion of the verse, the fluctuation of the
dialogue, provide the fit medium for the pregnancy and wealth of the
matter.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>But the scene is not yet at an end. Even now we are not for a moment
allowed to forget Brutus, the considerate gentleman and cultured
student, in Brutus, the political pedant and the incompetent commander.
We have a momentary glimpse of him with Lucius, unassuming and gentle,
claiming the indulgence, consulting the comfort, tending the needs of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
his slave. This moving little passage is, as we have seen, entirely
due to Shakespeare, and it seems to be introduced for the sake partly
of the dramatic contrast with the prevailing trouble and gloom, partly
of the indication it gives that Brutus is still unchanged at heart. In
the stress of his suffering he may be irritable and overbearing with
Cassius, but he has more than a woman’s tenderness for the boy.</p>

<p>His habit of reading at night is mentioned by Plutarch, but when
we consider the circumstances, has it not a deeper meaning here?
His love for Portia we know, but after his brief references to her
death, he seems to banish her from his mind, and never, not even
in his dying words, does her name cross his lips again. Is this an
inadvertence on Shakespeare’s part, or an omission due to the kinship
of <i>Julius Caesar</i> with the Chronicle History? Is it not rather
that he conceives Brutus as one of those who are so bound up in their
affections that they fear to face a thought of their bereavement lest
they should utterly collapse? Is it fanciful to interpret that search
for his book with the leaf turned down, in the light of Macaulay’s
confession on the death of his sister: “Literature has saved my life
and my reason; even now I dare not in the intervals of business remain
alone a minute without a book”?</p>

<p>But this little interlude, which sets Brutus before us with all his
winsome and pathetic charm, leads back to the leading <i>motif</i>, the
destruction he has brought on himself by his own error, though he may
face it like a man and keep the beauty of his soul unsoiled. Here, too,
Plutarch points the way, but Shakespeare advances further in it. What
he found was the following bit of hearsay:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">One night very late (when all the campe tooke
quiet rest) as he was in his tent with a little light, thinking of
waighty matters, he thought he heard one come in to him, and casting
his eye towards the doore of his tent, that he saw a wonderfull
straunge and monstruous shape of a body comming towards him, and sayd
never a word. So Brutus boldly asked what he was, a god, or a man, and
what cause brought him thither. The spirit aunswered him, “I am thy
evill spirit, Brutus, and thou shalt see me by the citie of Philippes.”
Brutus beeing no otherwise affrayd, replyed again unto it: “Well, then,
I shall see thee agayne.” The spirit presently vanished away: and
Brutus called his men unto him, who tolde him that they heard no noyse,
nor sawe any thinge at all.</p>

<p>Shakespeare’s Brutus is not at the outset so unconcerned as Plutarch’s.
Instead of “being no otherwise affrayd,” his blood runs cold and his
hair “stares.” On the other hand, he is free from the perturbation that
seizes Plutarch’s Brutus when he reflects, and that drives him to tell
his experience to Cassius, who “did somewhat comfort and quiet him.”
The Brutus of the play breathes no word of the visitation, though it
is repeated at Philippi, till a few minutes before his death, and then
in all composure as a proof that the end is near, not as a horror from
which he seeks deliverance. He needs not the support of another, and
even in the moment of physical panic he has moral courage enough: he
summons up his resolution, and when he has “taken heart” the spectre
vanishes. This means, too, that it has a closer connection with his
nerves, with his subjective fears and misgivings, than the “monstruous
shape” in Plutarch, and similarly, though he alleges that Lucius and
his attendants have cried out in their sleep, they are unaware of any
feeling or cause of fright. And the significance of this is marked
by the greatest change of all. Shakespeare gives a personality to
Plutarch’s nameless phantom: it is individualised as the ghost of
Caesar, and thus Caesar’s spirit has become Brutus’ evil genius, as
Brutus had been Caesar’s angel. The symbolism explains itself, but is
saved from the tameness of allegory by the superstitious dread with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
which it is enwrapped. The regrets and forebodings of Brutus appear
before him in outward form. All day the mischievousness of his
intervention has been present to his mind: now his accusing thoughts
take shape in the vision of his murdered friend, and his vague
presentiments of retribution at Philippi leap to consciousness in its
prophetic words. But all this does not abash his soul or shake his
purpose. He only hastens the morning march.</p>

<p>Thus he moves to his doom, and never was he so great. He is stripped
of all adventitious aids. His private affections are wrecked, and the
thought of his wife has become a torture. Facts have given the lie to
his belief that his country has chosen him as her champion. He can no
longer cherish the dream that his course has been of benefit to the
Roman world. He even seems at last to recognise his own guilt, for
not only does he admit the might of Caesar’s spirit in the suicide of
Cassius, but when his own turn comes, his dying words sound like a
proffer of expiation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Caesar, now be still;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I kill’d not thee with half so good a will.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> v. 50.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The philosophic harness in which he felt so
secure, he has already found useless in the hour of need, and fit only
to be cast aside. So he stands naked to the blows of fate, bereft of
his love, his illusions, his self-confidence, his creed. He has to rely
solely on himself, on his own nature and his own character. Moreover
his nature, in so far as it means temperament, is too delicate and fine
for the rough practical demands on it. Suspense is intolerable to his
sensitive and eager soul. Ere the battle begins, he can hardly endure
the uncertainty:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">O that a man might know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The end of this day’s business ere it come!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And then the end is known.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 123.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
The patience in which he tries to school himself cannot protect him
from a last blunder. He gives the word too soon and his impetuosity
ruins all. No doubt he is not so unsuccessful as Titinius thinks, but
he has committed the unpardonable fault of fighting for his own hand
without considering his partner. Thus his imprudence gives the final
blow to the cause that all through he has thwarted and ennobled.</p>

<p>But in inward and essential matters his character victoriously stands
the test, and meets all the calls that are made upon it. Even when his
life-failure stares him in the face, he does not allow it a wider scope
than its due, or let it disturb his faith in the purity of his motives.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Even now he can see himself aright, and be sure of
the truth of his patriotism. Even now he can prefer the glory of this
“losing day” to the “vile conquest” of such men as the authors of the
proscription. And he is not without more personal consolations. When
none of his friends will consent to kill him, their very refusal, since
it springs from love, fills his soul with triumph. It is characteristic
that this satisfaction to his private affections ranks with him as
supreme at the end of all.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">We need not bemoan his fate: he is happy in it:
indeed there is nothing that he could live for in the world of the
Triumvirs, and this is what he himself desires:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>At the side of this rare and lofty nature, we see the kindred figure of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
his wife, similar in her noble traits, similar in her experiences,
the true mate of his soul. Their relations are sketched in the merest
outline, or, to be more correct, are implied rather than sketched. Only
in some eighty lines of one scene do we see them together and hear them
exchange words. In only one other scene does Portia appear, when we
witness her tremors on the morning of the assassination. And in a third
we hear of her death in detached notices, which, with the comments they
call forth, barely amount to twenty lines. Yet the impression made
is indelible and overpowering, not only of the lady’s own character,
but of the perfect union in which she and Brutus lived. There is no
obtrusion of their love: it does not exhale in direct professions.
On her part, the claim to share his troubles, the solicitude for his
success, the distraction because of his absence and danger; on his,
the acceptance of her claim, two brief outbursts of adoration—and his
reticence at her death. For he is not the man to wear his heart on his
sleeve; and the more his feelings are stirred the less inclined is he
to prate of them. Just as after slaying Caesar though “he loved him
well,” he never alludes to the anguish he must have endured, so after
his “Farewell, Portia,” he turns to the claims of life (“Well, to our
work alive!”), and never even in soliloquy refers to her again. Even
in the first pang of bereavement, the one hint of grief it can extort
from him is the curt retort, “No man bears sorrow better.” We might
fail to recognise all that it meant for him if we did not see his
misery reflected in the sympathy and consternation of other men; in the
hesitating reluctance of Messala, to break, as he thinks, the news; in
the dismay of Cassius and his wonder at Brutus’ self-control. Cassius
indeed cannot but recur to it despite the prohibition, “Speak no more
of her.” When they have sat down to business his thoughts hark back to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
the great loss: “Portia, art thou gone?” “No more, I pray you,” repeats
Brutus, who cannot brook the mention of her, and he plunges into the
business of the hour.</p>

<p>And this woman, of whom Brutus felt that he was unworthy, and prayed
to be made worthy, noble and devoted as himself, is involved too in
his misfortunes. On her also a greater load is laid than she can bear.
He is drawn by his political, and she by her domestic ideal into a
position that overstrains the strength of each. She demands, as in
Plutarch, though perhaps with father less of the dignity of the Roman
matron and rather more of the yearning of the affectionate wife, to
share in her husband’s secrets. She does this from no curiosity,
intrusiveness or jealousy, but from her unbounded love and her exalted
conception of the marriage tie. And she is confident that she can bear
her part in her husband’s cares.</p>

<p>She has a great spirit, but it is lodged in a fragile and nervous
frame. Does she make her words good? She gains her point, but her
success is almost too much for her. She can endure pain but not
suspense: like Brutus she is martyr to her sense of what is right. We
presently find her all but ruining the conspiracy by her uncontrollable
agitation. The scene where she waits in the street serves the function
in the main story of heightening our excitement by means of hers, in
expectation of what will presently be enacted at the Capitol; but it is
even more important for the light it throws on her character. She may
well confess: “I have a man’s heart, but a woman’s might.” Her feverish
anxiety quite overmasters her throughout, and makes her do and say
things which do not disclose the plot only because the bystanders are
faithful or unobservant. She sends the boy to the senate house without
telling him his errand. She meaningly bids him</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
She interrupts herself with the fancy that the revolt has begun. She
plies the soothsayer with suspicious questions that culminate in the
most indiscreet one on his wish to help Caesar:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then she almost commits herself, and has to
extemporise a subterfuge, before, unable to hold out any longer, she
retires on the point of fainting, though even now her love gives her
strength to send a cheering message to her lord.</p>

<p>For her as for Brutus the burden of a duty, which she assumes by her
own choice, but which one of her nature must assume, is too heavy. And
in the after consequences, for which she is not directly responsible,
but which none the less flow from the deed that she has encouraged and
approved, it is the same inability to bear suspense, along with her
craving for her husband’s presence and success, that drives her through
madness to death.</p>

<p>Far beneath this pair are the other conspirators who rise up against
the supremacy of Caesar.</p>

<p>Among these lower natures, Cassius is undoubtedly the most imposing and
most interesting.</p>

<p>The main lines of his character are given in Caesar’s masterly
delineation, which follows Plutarch in regard to his spareness, but in
the other particulars freely elaborates the impression that Plutarch’s

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Lean, gaunt, hungry, disinclined to sports
and revelry, spending his time in reading, observation, and
reflection—these are the first traits that we notice in him. He too,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
like Brutus, has learned the lessons of philosophy, and he finds in
it the rule of life. He chides his friend for seeming to fail in the
practice of it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of your philosophy you make no use,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And even when he admits and admires Brutus’ self-mastery, he attributes
it to nature, and claims as good a philosophic discipline for himself.
There is, however, a difference between them even in this point.
Brutus is a Platonist with a Stoic tinge; Cassius is an Epicurean.
That strikes us at first as strange, that the theory which identified
pleasure with virtue should be the creed of this splenetic solitary:
but it is quite in character. Epicureanism appealed to some of the
noblest minds of Rome, not as a cult of enjoyment, but as a doctrine
that freed them from the bonds of superstition and the degrading fear
of death. This was the spirit of Lucretius, the poet of the sect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">Artis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Religionum animum nodis exsolvere pergo:</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and one grand <i>motif</i> of his poem is the
thought that this death, the dread of which makes the meanness of life,
is the end of all consciousness, a refuge rather than an evil: “What
ails thee so, O mortal, to let thyself loose in too feeble grievings?
Why weep and wail at death?... Why not rather make an end of life and
labour?” And these are the reasons that Cassius is an Epicurean. At the
end, when his philosophy breaks down, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You know that I held Epicurus strong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his opinion: now I change my mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And partly credit things that do presage.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 77.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He has hitherto discredited them. And we seem to
hear Lucretius in his noble utterance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,</div>

<p class="no-indent">Free from all superstitious scruples and all

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 139.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And the same attitude of mind implies that he
is rid of all illusions. He is not deceived by shows. He looks quite
through the deeds of men. He is not taken in by Casca’s affectation
of rudeness. He is not misled by Antony’s apparent frivolity. He is
not even dazzled by the glamour of Brutus’ virtue, but notes its weak
side and does not hesitate to play on it. Still less does Caesar’s
prestige subdue his criticism. On the contrary, with malicious contempt
he recalls his want of endurance in swimming and the complaints of
his sick-bed, and he keenly notes his superstitious lapses. He seldom
smiles and when he does it is in scorn. We only once hear of his
laughing. It is at the interposition of the poet, which rouses Brutus
to indignation; but the presumptuous absurdity of it tickles Cassius’
sardonic humour.</p>

<p>For there is no doubt that he takes pleasure in detecting the
weaknesses of his fellows. He has obvious relish in the thought that
if he were Brutus he would not be thus cajoled, and he finds food for
satisfaction in Caesar’s merely physical defects. Yet there is as
little of self-complacency as of hero-worship in the man. He turns his
remorseless scrutiny on his own nature and his own cause, and neither
maintains that the one is noble or the other honourable, nor denies the
personal alloy in his motives. This is the purport of that strange
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
soliloquy that at first sight seems to place Cassius in the ranks of
Shakespeare’s villains along with his Iagos and Richards, rather than
of the mixed characters, compact of good and evil, to whom nevertheless
we feel that he is akin.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Well, Brutus, thou art noble: yet, I see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy honourable metal may be wrought</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">That noble minds keep ever with their likes:</div>

    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 312.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It frequently happens that cynics view themselves
as well as others in their meaner aspects. Probably Cassius is making
the worst of his own case and is indulging that vein of self-mockery
and scorn that Caesar observed in him.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
But at any rate the lurking sense of unworthiness in himself and his
purpose will be apt to increase in such a man his natural impatience of
alleged superiority in his fellows. He is jealous of excellence, seeks
to minimise it and will not tolerate it. It is on this characteristic
that Shakespeare lays stress. Plutarch reports the saying “that
Brutus could evill away with the tyrannie and that Cassius hated the
tyranne, making many complayntes for the injuries he had done him”;
and instances Caesar’s appropriation of some lions that Cassius had
intended for the sports, as well as the affair of the city praetorship.
But in the play these specific grievances are almost effaced in the
vague statement, “Caesar doth bear me hard”; which implies little more
than general ill-will. It is now resentment of pre-eminence that makes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
Cassius a malcontent. Caesar finds him “very dangerous” just because
of his grudge at greatness; and his own avowal that he “would as lief
not be as live to be in awe” of a thing like himself, merely puts a
fairer colour on the same unamiable trait. He may represent republican
liberty and equality, at least in the aristocratic acceptation, but
it is on their less admirable side. His disposition is to level down,
by repudiating the leader, not to level up, by learning from him. In
the final results this would mean the triumph of the second best, a
dull and uniform mediocrity in art, thought and politics, unbroken
by the predominance of the man of genius and king of men. And it may
be feared that this ideal, translated into the terms of democracy,
is too frequent in our modern communities. But true freedom is not
incompatible with the most loyal acknowledgment of the master-mind;
witness the utterance of Browning’s Pisan republican:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">The mass remains—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Keep but the model safe, new men will rise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take its mould.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Yet notwithstanding this taint of enviousness and spite, Cassius is
far from being a despicable or even an unattractive character. He may
play the Devil’s Advocate in regard to individuals, but he is capable
of a high enthusiasm for his cause, such as it is. We must share his
calenture of excitement, as he strides about the streets in the tempest
that fills Casca with superstitious dread and Cicero with discomfort
at the nasty weather. His republicanism may be a narrow creed, but at
least he is willing to be a martyr to it; when he hears that Caesar is
to wear the crown, his resolution is prompt and Roman-like:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I know where I will wear this dagger then:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 89.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And surely at the moment of achievement, whatever was mean and sordid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
in the man is consumed in his prophetic rapture that fires the soul of
Brutus and prolongs itself in his response.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cassius.</i><span class="ws3">How many ages hence</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 111.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And even to individuals if they stand the test of his mordant
criticism, he can pay homage and admiration. The perception that Brutus
may be worked upon is the toll he pays to his self-love, but, that
settled, he can feel deep reverence and affection for Brutus’ more
ideal virtue. Perhaps the best instance of it is the scene of their
dispute. Brutus, as we have seen, is practically, if not theoretically,
in the wrong, and certainly he is much the more violent and bitter; but
Cassius submits to receive his forgiveness and to welcome his assurance
that he will bear with him in future. This implies no little deference
and magnanimity in one who so ill brooks a secondary role. But he does
give the lead to Brutus, and in all things, even against his better
judgment, yields him the primacy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>And then it is impossible not to respect his thorough efficiency. In
whatsoever concerns the management of affairs and of men, he knows the
right thing to do, and, when left to himself, he does it. He sees how
needful Brutus is to the cause and gains him—gains him, in part by a
trickery, which Shakespeare without historical warrant ascribes to him;
but the trickery succeeds because he has gauged Brutus’ nature aright.
He takes the correct measure of the danger from Antony, of his love for
Caesar and his talents, which Brutus so contemptuously underrates. So,
too, after the assassination, when Brutus says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I know that we shall have him well to friend;</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 144.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Brutus seeks to win Antony with general
considerations of right and justice, Cassius employs a more effective
argument:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the disposing of new dignities.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 177.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He altogether disapproves of the permission
granted to Antony to pronounce the funeral oration. He grasps the
situation when the civil war breaks out much better than Brutus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In such a time as this it is not meet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That every nice offence should bear his comment.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iii. 7.)</div>
 </div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">His plans of the campaign are better, and he has a
much better notion of conducting the battle.</p>

<p>All such shrewd sagacity is entitled to our respect. Yet even in this
department Cassius is outdone by the unpractical Brutus, so soon as
higher moral qualities are required, and the wisdom of the fox yields
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
to the wisdom of the man. We have seen that however passionate and
wrong-headed Brutus may be in their contention, he has too much sense
of the becoming to wrangle in public, as Cassius begins to do. Another
more conspicuous example is furnished by the way in which they bear
anxiety. Shakespeare found an illustration of this in Plutarch, which
he has merely dramatised.</p>

<p class="blockquot">When Caesar came out of his litter: Popilius
Laena, that had talked before with Brutus and Cassius, and had prayed
the goddes they might bring this enterprise to passe, went into Caesar
and kept him a long time with a talke. Caesar gave good eare unto him.
Wherefore the conspirators (if so they should be called) not hearing
what he sayd to Caesar, but conjecturing by that he had told them a
little before, that his talke was none other but the verie discoverie
of their conspiracie: they were affrayed everie man of them, and one
looking in an others face, it was easie to see that they all were of a
minde, that it was no tarying for them till they were apprehended, but
rather that they should kill them selves with their owne handes. And
when Cassius and certaine other clapped their handes on their swordes
under their gownes to draw them: Brutus marking the countenaunce and
gesture of Laena, and considering that he did use him selfe rather like
an humble and earnest suter, then like an accuser: he sayd nothing to
his companions (bicause there were amongest them that were not of the
conspiracie) but with a pleasaunt countenaunce encouraged Cassius. And
immediatlie after, Laena went from Caesar, and kissed his hande; which
shewed plainlie that it was for some matter concerning him selfe, that
he had held him so long in talke.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, by rejecting the reason for the dumb show, is able to
present this scene in dialogue, and thus bring out the contrast more
vividly. Cassius believes the worst, loses his head, now hurries on
Casca, now prepares for suicide. But Brutus, the disinterested man, is
less swayed by personal hopes and fears, keeps his composure, urges his
friend to be constant, and can calmly judge of the situation. It is
the same defect of endurance that brings about Cassius’ death. Really
things are shaping well for them, but he misconstrues the signs just as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
he has misconstrued the words of Lena, and kills himself owing to a
mistake; as Messala points out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 66.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This want of inward strength explains the ascendancy which Brutus with
his more dutiful and therefore more steadfast nature exercises over
him, though Cassius is in many ways the more capable man of the two.
They both have schooled themselves in the discipline of fortitude,
Brutus in Stoic renunciation, Cassius in Epicurean independence; but
in the great crises where nature asserts herself, Brutus is strong and
Cassius is weak. And as often happens with men, in the supreme trial
their professed creeds no longer satisfy them, and they consciously
abandon them. But while Cassius in his evil fortune falls back on the
superstitions<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
which he had ridiculed Caesar for adopting on his good fortune, Brutus
falls back on his feeling of moral dignity, and gives himself the death
which theoretically he disapproves.</p>

<p>Yet, when all is said and done, what a fine figure Cassius is, and how
much both of love and respect he can inspire. Plutarch’s story of his
death already bears witness to this, but Shakespeare with a few deeper
strokes marks his own esteem.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cassius thinking in deede that Titinius was taken
of the enemies, he then spake these wordes: “Desiring too much to live,
I have lived to see one of my best frendes taken, for my sake, before
my face.” After that, he gote into a tent where no bodie was, and tooke
Pyndarus with him, one of his freed bondmen, whom he reserved ever for
suche a pinche, since the cursed battell of the Parthians, when Crassus
was slaine, though he notwithstanding scaped from that overthrow; but
then casting his cloke over his head, and holding out his bare neck
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
unto Pindarus, he gave him his head to be striken of. So the head was
found severed from the bodie: but after that time Pindarus was never
seene more. Whereupon some tooke occasion to say that he had slaine
his master without his commaundement. By and by they knew the horsemen
that came towards them, and might see Titinius crowned with a garland
of triumphe, who came before with great speede unto Cassius. But when
he perceived by the cries and teares of his frends which tormented them
selves the misfortune that had chaunced to his Captaine Cassius by
mistaking; he drew out his sword, cursing him selfe a thousand times
that he had taried so long, and so slue him selfe presentlie in the
fielde. Brutus in the meane time came forward still, and understoode
also that Cassius had bene over throwen: but he knew nothing of his
death, till he came verie neere to his campe. So when he was come
thither, after he had lamented the death of Cassius, calling him the
last of all the Romanes, being impossible that Rome should ever breede
againe so noble and valliant man as he: he caused his bodie to be
buried, and sent it to the citie of Thassos, fearing least his funerals
within the campe should cause great disorder.</p>

<p>In the play Pindarus is not yet enfranchised, and though he gains his
freedom by the fatal stroke, would rather remain a slave than return to
his native wilds at such a price. Titinius places his garland on the
dead man’s brow, and in fond regret slays himself, not with his own but
with Cassius’ sword. Brutus, with hardly a verbal change, repeats the
eulogy that Plutarch puts in his mouth,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is impossible that ever Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Should breed thy fellow.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But he does not stop here. Flushed with his
initial success, he expects to triumph and to live, and the years to
come seem darkened with grief for his “brother”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Friends, I owe more tears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To this dead man than you shall see me pay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 99.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The minor conspirators, with the adherents of the cause and the humbler
dependents, are of course sketched very slightly, as proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
requires, but they have all something to individualise them in gait
or pose. Even in the crowded final act, where, as in the chronicle
histories which Shakespeare was leaving behind him, a number of persons
are introduced with whom we are almost or entirely unacquainted, there
is no monotony in the subordinate figures. They are distinguished from
or contrasted with each other in their circumstances, sentiments or
fate. Thus Pindarus and Strato are both described as servants, they are
both attached to their masters, they are both reluctantly compelled
to assist in their masters’ death. Should we have thought it possible
to differentiate them in the compass of the score or so of lines at
the dramatist’s disposal? But Cassius’ slave, who, since his capture,
has been kept like a dog to do whatever his owner might bid him, will
not abide the issue and uses his new liberty to flee beyond the Roman
world. Strato, to whom Brutus characteristically turns because he
is “a fellow of a good respect” with “some snatch of honour” in his
life, claims Brutus’ hand like an equal before he will hold the sword,
confronts the victors with praise of the dead, hints to Messala that
Brutus’ course is the one to follow, and has too much self-respect
to accept employment with Octavius till Messala “prefers,” that is,
recommends him.</p>

<p>So too with the three captains, all on the losing side, all devoted to
their leaders. Titinius, who seems to feel that his love for Cassius
exceeds that of Brutus</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent17">(Brutus, come apace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And see how I regarded Caius Cassius)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">will not outlive him. Lucilius is quite ready to
die for his general, but spared by the generosity of Antony, survives
to exult that Brutus has fulfilled his prophecy and been “like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
himself.” Messala, who brought word of Portia’s death, must now tell
the same tale of Cassius with the same keen sympathy for Brutus’ grief;
and though Strato seems to censure him for consenting to live “in
bondage,” he shows no bondman’s mind when he grounds his preferment
of Strato to Octavius on the fact of Strato’s having done “the latest
service to my master.”</p>

<p>More prominent, but still in the background, are the subaltern members
of the faction in Rome. Ligarius, the best of them, with his fiery
enthusiasm and personal fealty to Brutus, is an excellent counterpart
to the ingratiating and plausible Decius, the least erected spirit of
the group. Between them comes Casca, the only one who may claim a word
or two of comment, partly because he is sketched in some detail, partly
because he is practically an original creation. Plutarch has only two
particulars about him, the one that he was the first to strike Caesar
and struck him from behind; the other that when Caesar cried out and
gripped his hand, he shouted to his brother in Greek. Shakespeare, as
we have seen, summarily rejects his acquaintance with Greek, but the
stab in the back sets his fancy to work, and he constructs for him a
character and life-history to match.</p>

<p>Casca is a man who shares with Cassius the jealousy of greatness—“the
envious Casca,” Antony described him—but is vastly inferior to
Cassius in consistency and manhood. He seems to be one of those alert,
precocious natures, clever at the uptake in their youth and full of a
promise that is not always fulfilled: Brutus recalls that “he was quick
mettle when we went to school” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 300).
Such sprightly youngsters, when they fail, often do so from a certain lack
of moral fibre. And so with Casca. He appears before us at first as the
most obsequious henchman of Caesar. When Caesar calls for Calpurnia, Casca
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
is at his elbow: “Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.” When Caesar, hearing
the soothsayer’s shout, cries, “Ha! who calls?” Casca is again
ready: “Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!” Cassius would
never have condescended to that. For Casca resents the supremacy of
Caesar as much as the proudest aristocrat of them all: he is only
waiting an opportunity to throw off the mask. But meanwhile in his
angry bitterness with himself and others he affects a cross-grained
bluntness of speech, “puts on a tardy form,” as Cassius says, plays the
satirist and misanthrope, as many others conscious of double dealing
have done, and treats friend and foe with caustic brutality. But it
is characteristic that he is panic-stricken with the terrors of the
tempestuous night, which he ekes out with superstitious fancies. It
illustrates his want both of inward robustness and of enlightened
culture. We remember that Cicero’s remark in Greek was Greek to him,
and that Greek was as much the language of rationalists then, as was
French of the eighteenth century <i>Philosophes</i>. Nor is it less
characteristic that even at the assassination he apparently does not
dare to face his victim. Antony describes his procedure</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Damned Casca, like a cur, behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Struck Caesar on the neck.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 43.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Yet even Casca is not without redeeming qualities.
His humour, in the account he gives of the coronation fiasco, has an
undeniable flavour: its very tartness, as Cassius says, is a “sauce to
his good wit.” And there is a touch of nobility in his avowal:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You speak to Casca, and to such a man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And I will set this foot of mine as far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As who goes farthest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 116.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But among those little vignettes, that of Cicero is decidedly the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
masterpiece. For this Shakespeare got no assistance from any of the
three Lives on which he drew for the rest of the play. Indeed the
one little hint they contained he did not see fit to adopt. In the
<i>Marcus Brutus</i> Plutarch says of the conspirators:</p>

<p class="blockquot">For this cause they durst not acquaint Cicero with
their conspiracie, although he was a man whome they loved dearlie and
trusted best: for they were affrayed that he being a coward by nature,
and age also having increased his feare, he would quite turne and alter
all their purpose.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In the play their reason for leaving him out
is very different:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He will never follow anything</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That other men begin.</div>
    <div class="verse indent17">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 151.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It seems to me, however, highly probable that
Shakespeare had read the <i>Life of Cicero</i> and obtained his
general impression from it, though he invents the particular traits.
The irritable vanity and self-consciousness of the man, which Brutus’
objection implies, are, for example, prominent features in Plutarch’s
portrait. So too is his aversion for Caesar and Caesarism, which makes
him view the offer of the crown, abortive though it has been, as a
personal offence: Brutus observes that he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As we have seen him in the Capitol</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Being cross’d in conference with some senators.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 186.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But he is very cautious, and even when venting
his vexation in one of those biting gibes to which, by Plutarch’s
statement, he was too prone, he takes care to veil it in the safe
obscurity of a foreign language. “He spoke Greek ... but those
that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads”
(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 282). This has sometimes been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
misinterpreted. Shakespeare has been taxed with the absurdity of making
Cicero deliver a Greek speech in a popular assemblage. Surely he does
nothing of the kind. It is a sally that he intends for his friends, and
he takes the fit means for keeping it to them; much as St. John might
talk French, if he wished to be intelligible only to those who had made
the Grand Tour and so were in a manner of his own set. Plutarch lays
stress on his familiarity with Greek, as also on his study of the Greek
Philosophers. This may have left some trace in the description of his
bearing in contrast to Casca’s, when they meet in the storm. Cool and
sceptical, he cannot guess the cause of Casca’s alarm. Even when the
horrors of earthquake, wind and lightning, are described in detail, he
asks unmoved:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Why, saw you anything more wonderful?</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And after the enumeration of the portents,
he critically replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But men may construe things after their fashion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 32.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And then after a passing reference<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
to current affairs, he bids Casca good night. To him the moral of the
whole tempest is: “This disturbed sky is not to walk in.” Opinions may
differ as to this being the real Cicero; none will deny that it is a
living type.</p>

<p>Apart from the main group of personages, more or less antagonistic to
Caesar, stands the brilliant figure of his friend and avenger, the
eloquent Mark Antony. Shakespeare conceives him as a man of genius and
feeling but not of principle, resourceful and daring, ambitious of
honour and power, but unscrupulous in his methods and a voluptuary in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
his life. Caesar tells him that he is “fond of plays” and “revels long
o’ nights.” Cassius calls him a “masker and a reveller.” Brutus says
that he is given “to sports, to wildness and much company.”</p>

<p>He makes his first appearance as the tool of Caesar. With Asiatic
flattery, as though in the eastern formula, to hear were to obey, he
tells his master:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When Caesar says “do this,” it is perform’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 10.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He perceives his unspoken desires, his innermost
wishes, and offers him the crown. It is no wonder that Brutus should
regard him but as a “limb of Caesar,” or that Trebonius, considering
him a mere time-server, should prophesy that he will “live and laugh”
hereafter at Caesar’s death. But they are wrong. They do not recognise
either the genuineness of the affection that underlies his ingratiating
ways, or the real genius that underlies his frivolity. Here, as
everywhere, Cassius’ estimate is the correct one. He fears Antony’s
“ingrafted love” for Caesar, and predicts that they will find in him “a
shrewd contriver.” Of the love indeed there can be no question. It is
proved not only by his public utterances, which might be factitious,
nor by his deeds, which might serve his private purposes, but by his
words, when he is alone with his patron’s corpse.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">That ever lived in the tide of times.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 254.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is worth noting the grounds that Antony in this solitary
outburst alleges for his love of Caesar. He is moved not by gratitude for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
favours past or the expectation of favours to come, but solely by the
supreme nobility of the dead. To the claims of nobility, in truth,
Antony is always responsive and he is ready to acknowledge it in
Brutus too. “This was the noblest Roman of them all”; so he begins his
heartfelt tribute to his vanquished foe. This generous sympathetic
strain in his nature is one of the things that make him dangerous. He
is far from acting a part in his laments for Caesar. He feels the grief
that he proclaims and the greatness he extols. His emotions are easily
stirred, especially by worthy objects, and he has only to give them
free rein to impress other people.</p>

<p>But along with this he has a subtle, scheming intellect; he is as much
a man of policy as a man of sentiment. After the flight of Brutus
and Cassius, we see him planning how he and his colleagues may cut
down Caesar’s bequests, of which in his speech he had made so much;
how he may shift some of the odium of his proceedings on to Lepidus’
back; how they may best arrange to meet the opposition. This mixture
of feeling and diplomacy is especially shown in his words and deeds
after the assassination. He does not shrink from any base compliance.
His servant appears before the murderers, and at his bidding “kneels,”
“falls down,” lies “prostrate” in token of submission, promising that
his master will follow Brutus’ fortunes. But even here it is on the
understanding that Caesar’s death shall be justified; and when he
himself enters he gives his love and grief free scope.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">What could be more loyal on the one hand, or more
discreet on the other? For, as he is well aware, if he comes to terms
with the assassins at all, he is liable to an alternative accusation.
Either his love for Caesar was genuine, and then his reconciliation
with the murderers implies craven fear; or, if he can freely take their
part, his previous homage to Caesar was mere pretence. As he himself says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 191.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And what more dexterous course could he adopt
than to assert his devotion to Caesar without restraint, with
undiminished emphasis: and at the same time to profess his respect for
the conspirators, “the choice and master spirits of this age,” and his
readiness to join them <i>if</i> they prove that Caesar deserved to
die. This honourable and reasonable attitude, which honour and reason
would in reality prescribe, must especially impress Brutus, to whom
Antony is careful chiefly to address himself. He enters a doubtful
suppliant; at the end of the scene not only are his life and credit
safe, but he has won from Brutus’ magnanimity the means to overthrow him.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Antony that he has no scruple about using the
vantage ground he has thus acquired. He immediately determines to
employ the liberty of speech accorded him against the men who have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
granted it. To Octavius’ servant, who enters ere he has well ended his
soliloquy, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the market place: there shall I try,</div>

    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 291.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He does not hesitate, though this course will
involve in ruin those who have generously spared him and given him the
weapons against themselves. Not even for his country’s sake will he
pause, though, with his prescient imagination, he sees in all their
lurid details the horrors of the</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">that must inevitably ensue.</p>

<p>And he effects his purpose, without any other help, by his wonderful
address to the citizens. Perhaps nowhere else in History or Literature
do we find the procedure of the demagogue of Genius set forth with such
masterly insight. For Antony shows himself a demagogue of the most
profligate description, but as undeniably the very genius of the art of
moving men. Consider the enormous difficulties of his position. He is
speaking under limitation and by permission before a hostile audience
that will barely give him a hearing, and his task is to turn them quite
round, and make them adore what they hated and hate what they adored.
How does he set about it?</p>

<p>He begins with an acknowledgment and compliment to Brutus: “For Brutus’
sake I am beholding to you.” He disclaims the intention of even
praising the dead. He cites the charge of ambition, but not to reply
to it, merely to point out that any ambition has been expiated. But
then he insinuates arguments on the other side: Caesar’s faithfulness
and justice in friendship, the additions not to his private but to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
public wealth that his victories secured, his pitifulness to the poor,
his refusal of the crown. Really these things are no arguments at
all. They have either nothing to do with the case, or are perfectly
compatible with ambition, or may have been its very means or may have
been meant to cloak it. Such indeed we know that in part at least
they were. But that does not signify so far as Antony’s purpose is
concerned. They were all matters well known to the public, fit to call
forth proud and grateful and pleasing reminiscences of Caesar’s career.
The orator has managed to praise Caesar while not professing to do
so: if he does not disprove what Brutus said, yet in speaking what he
does know, he manages to discredit Brutus’ authority. And now these
regretful associations stirred, he can at any rate ask their tears for
their former favourite. Have they lost their reason that they do not
at least mourn for him they once loved? And here with a rhetorical
trick, which, to his facile, emotional nature, may have also been the
suggestion of real feeling, his utterance fails him; he must pause, for
his “heart is in the coffin there with Caesar.”</p>

<p>We may be sure that whatever had happened to his heart his ear was
intent to catch the murmurs of the crowd. They would satisfy him.
Though he has not advanced one real argument, but has only played as it
were on their sensations, their mood has changed. Some think Caesar has
had wrong, some are convinced that he was not ambitious, all are now
thoroughly favourable to Antony.</p>

<p>He begins again. And now he strikes the note of contrast between
Caesar’s greatness yesterday and his impotence to-day. It is such a
tragic fall as in itself might move all hearts to terror and pity.
But what if the catastrophe were undeserved? Antony could prove that
it was, but he will keep faith with the conspirators and refrain.
Nevertheless he has the testament, though he will not read it, which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
read, would show them that Caesar was their best friend.</p>

<p>Compassion, curiosity, selfishness are now enlisted on his side. Cries
of “The will! The will!” arise. He is quick to take advantage of these.
Just as he would not praise Caesar, yet did so all the same; so he
refuses to read the will, for they would rise in mutiny—this is a
little preliminary hint to them—if they heard that Caesar had made
them his heirs.</p>

<p>Renewed insistence on the part of the mob, renewed coyness on the part
of Antony; till at last he steps down from the pulpit, taking care to
have a wide circle round him that as many as possible may see. But he
does not read the will immediately. Partly with his incomparable eye
to effect, partly out of the fullness of his heart (for the substance
of his words is the same as in his private soliloquy), he stands rapt
above the body. Caesar’s mantle recalls proud memories of the glory of
Caesar and of Rome, the victory over the Barbarian.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
And this mantle is pierced by the stabs of assassins, of Cassius, of
Casca, of Brutus himself. He has now advanced so far that he can attack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
the man who was the idol of the mob but a few minutes before. And he
makes his attack well. The very superiority of Brutus to personal
claims, the very patriotism which none could appreciate better than
Antony, and to which he does large justice when Brutus is no more, this
very disinterestedness he turns against Brutus, and despite all he owes
him, accuses him of black ingratitude. There is so much speciousness in
the charge that it would be hard to rebut before a tribunal of sages:
and when Antony makes his <i>coup</i>, withdrawing the mantle and
displaying the mutilated corpse,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 199.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">the cause of Brutus is doomed. Antony has a right
to exult, and he does so. There is the triumphant pride of the artist
in his art, when, on resuming, he represents Brutus as the rhetorician
and himself as the unpractised speaker. He is no orator as Brutus
is, and—with sublime effrontery—that was probably the reason he was
permitted to address them. But</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 230.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Note the last words: for though Antony feels
entitled to indulge in this farcing and enjoys it thoroughly, he does
not forget the serious business. He keeps recurring more and more
distinctly to the suggestion of mutiny, and for mutiny the citizens are
now more than fully primed. All this, moreover, he has achieved without
ever playing his trump card. They have quite forgotten about the will,
and indeed it is not required. But Antony thinks it well to have them
beside themselves, so he calls them back for this last maddening draught.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>And all the while, it will be observed, he has never answered Brutus’
charge on which he rested his whole case, that Caesar was ambitious.
Yet such is the headlong flight of his eloquence, winged by genius, by
passion, by craft, that his audience never perceive this. No wonder: it
is apt to escape even deliberate readers.</p>

<p>Such a man will go fast and far. We next see him practically the ruler
of Rome, swaying the triumvirate, treating Octavius as an admiring
pupil whom he will tutor in the trade, ordering about or ridiculing the
insignificant and imitative Lepidus.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>But he has the <i>hybris</i> of genius, unaccompanied by character
and undermined by licence. It would be an anomaly if such an one
were to be permanently successful. Shakespeare was by and by, though
probably as yet he knew it not, to devote a whole play to the story of
his downfall; here he contents himself with indicating his impending
deposition and the agent who shall accomplish it. There is something
ominous about the reticence, assurance, and calm self-assertion of the
“stripling or springall of twenty years” as Plutarch calls Octavius.
At the proscription Lepidus and even Antony are represented as
consenting to the death of their kinsfolk: Octavius makes demands but
no concessions. When Lepidus is ordered off on his errand, and Antony,
secure in his superiority, explains his methods, Octavius listens
silent with just a hint of dissent, but we feel that he is learning
his lessons and will apply them in due time at his teacher’s expense.
Already he appropriates the leadership. Before Philippi, Antony assigns
to him the left wing and he calmly answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Antony.</i> Why do you cross me in this exigent?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Octavius.</i> I do not cross you: but I will do so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 18.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
All these touches are contributed by Shakespeare, but the last is
especially noticeable, because, though the words and the particular
turn are his own, the incident itself is narrated not of Antony and
Octavius but of their opponents.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Then Brutus prayed Cassius he might have the
leading of the right winge, the whiche men thought was farre meeter for
Cassius: both bicause he was the elder man, and also for that he had
the better experience. But yet Cassius gave it him.</p>

<p>Octavius too has a higher conception of the dignity of his position.
In that strange scene, another of Shakespeare’s additions, when the
adversaries exchange <i>gabs</i>, like the heroes of the old Teutonic
lays or the <i>Chansons de Gestes</i>, it is Antony who suggests the
somewhat unseemly proceeding and it is Octavius who breaks it off. And
at the close he, as it were, constitutes himself the heir of Brutus’
reputation, and assumes as a matter of course that he has the right and
duty to provide for Brutus’ followers and take order for Brutus’ funeral.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All that served Brutus, I will entertain them ...</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">For the first of these statements there is no
warrant in Plutarch, and the second contradicts the impression his
narrative produces; for in all the mention he makes of the final
honours paid to Brutus, he gives the credit to Antony.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Antonius, having found Brutus bodie, he caused it to be wrapped up
in one of the richest cote armors he had. Afterwards also, Antonius

his mother.</p>

commaundement to one of his slaves infranchised to defray the charge of

<p>By means of these additions and displacements Shakespeare shows the
young Octavius with his tenacity and self-control already superseding
his older and more brilliant colleague. We see in them the beginning as
well as the prophecy of the end.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">POSITION OF THE PLAY AFTER THE GREAT TRAGEDIES.<br />
SHAKESPEARE’S INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT</span></h3>
</div>

<p>It may be taken as certain that Shakespeare did not at once set
about continuing the story which he had brought to the end of one
of its stages in <i>Julius Caesar</i> and of the future progress of
which he had in that play given the partial programme. <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i> belongs to a different phase of his development.</p>

<p>Though not published, so far as we know, till it appeared in the
Folio Edition of 1623, there is not much difficulty in finding its
approximate date; and that, despite its close connection with <i>Julius
Caesar</i> in the general march of events and in the re-employment of
some of the characters, was some half-dozen years after the composition
of its predecessor. The main grounds for this opinion, now almost
universally accepted, are the following:</p>

<p>1. We learn from the <i>Stationers’ Register</i> that the publisher,
Edward Blount, had entered a “booke called <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>”
on May 20th, 1608. Some critics have maintained that this could not be
Shakespeare’s in view of the fact that in November, 1623, license was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
granted to the same Blount and the younger Jaggard, with whom he was
now co-operating, to include in the collected edition the Shakespearian
piece among sixteen plays of which the copies were “not formerly
entered to other men.” But the objection hardly applies, as the
previous entry was in Blount’s favour, and, though he is now associated
with Jaggard, he may not have thought it necessary, because of a
change of firm as it were, to describe himself as “another man.” Even,
however, if the authorship of the 1608 play be considered doubtful,
its publication is significant. For, as has often been pointed out, it
was customary when a piece was successful at one theatre to produce
one on a similar subject at another. The mere existence, then, of an
<i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in the early months of 1608, is in so far
an argument that about that time the great <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>
was attracting attention.</p>

<p>2. There is evidence that in the preceding years Shakespeare was
occupied with and impressed by the <i>Life of Antony</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Plutarch tells how sorely Antony took to heart what he
considered the disloyalty of his followers after Actium.</p>

<p class="blockquot">He forsooke the citie and companie of his frendes,
and built him a house in the sea, by the Ile of Pharos, upon certaine
forced mountes which he caused to be cast into the sea, and dwelt
there, as a man that banished him selfe from all mens companie; saying
he would live Timons life, bicause he had the like wrong offered him,
that was affore offered unto Timon: and that for the unthankefulnes of
those he had done good unto, and whom he tooke to be his frendes he was
angry with all men, and would trust no man.</p>

<p>In reference to this withdrawal of Antony’s to the Timoneon, as he
called his solitary house, Plutarch inserts the story of Timon of
Athens, and there is reason to believe that Shakespeare made his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
contributions to the play of that name just before he wrote
<i>Macbeth</i>, about the year 1606.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) In <i>Macbeth</i> itself he has utilised the <i>Marcus
Antonius</i> probably for one passage and certainly for another. In
describing the scarcity of food among the Roman army in Parthia,
Plutarch says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">In the ende they were compelled to live of erbes
and rootes, but they found few of them that men doe commonly eate of,
and were enforced to tast of them that were never eaten before: among
the which there was one that killed them, and <i>made them out of their
witts</i>. For he that had once eaten of it, his memorye was gone from
him, and he knewe no manner of thing.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare is most likely thinking of this when after the
disappearance of the witches, he makes Banquo exclaim in bewilderment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Were such things here as we do speak about?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or have we eaten on the insane <i>root</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That <i>takes the reason prisoner</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 83.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In any case <i>Macbeth</i> contains an
unmistakable reminiscence of the soothsayer’s warning to Antony.</p>

<p class="blockquot">He ... told Antonius plainly, that his fortune
(which of it selfe was excellent good, and very great) was altogether
bleamished, and obscured by Caesars fortune: and therefore he
counselled him utterly to leave his company, and to get him as farre

good angell and spirit that kepeth thee), “is affraied of his, and
being coragious and high when he is alone, becometh fearefull and
timerous when he commeth neere unto the other.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare was to make use of this in detail when

<p class="no-indent">It is hard to believe that there is no connection
between these passages, and if there is Shakespeare must have been the
debtor; but as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
<i>Bussy d’Ambois</i> was acted before 1600, this loan is without much
value as a chronological indication.</p>

<p>3. Internal evidence likewise points to a date shortly after the
composition of <i>Macbeth</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In versification especially valuable indications are
furnished by the proportion of what Professor Ingram has called the
light and the weak endings. By these terms he denotes the conclusion of
the verse with a syllable that cannot easily or that cannot fully bear
the stress which the normal scansion would lay upon it. In either case
the effect is to break down the independence of the separate line as
unit, and to vest the rhythm in the couplet or sequence, by forcing us
on till we find an adequate resting-place. It thus has some analogy in
formal prosody to enjambement, or the discrepancy between the metrical
and the grammatical pause in prosody when viewed in connection with
the sense. Now the employment of light and weak endings, on the one
hand, and of enjambement on the other, is, generally speaking, much
more frequent in the plays that are considered to be late than in those
that are considered to be early. The tendency to enjambement indeed may
be traced farther back and proceeds less regularly. But the laxity in
regard to the endings comes with a rush and seems steadily to advance.
It is first conspicuous in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> and reaches
its maximum in <i>Henry VIII.</i> In this progress however there is
one notable peculiarity. While it is unmistakable if the percentage
be taken from the light and weak endings combined, or from the weak
endings alone, it breaks down if the light endings be considered by
themselves. Of them there is a decidedly higher proportion in <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> than in <i>Coriolanus</i>, which nevertheless is
almost universally held to be the later play. The reason probably is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
that the light endings mean a less revolutionary departure from the
more rigid system and would therefore be the first to be attempted.
When the ear had accustomed itself to them, it would be ready to accept
the greater innovation. Thus the sudden outcrop of light and weak
endings in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, the preponderance of the light
over the weak in that play, the increase in the total percentage of
such endings and especially in the relative percentage of weak endings
in the dramas that for various reasons are believed to be later, all
confirm its position after <i>Macbeth</i> and before <i>Coriolanus</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The diction tells the same tale. Whether we admire it or no,
we must admit that it is very concise, bold and difficult. Gervinus
censures it as “forced, abrupt and obscure”; and it certainly makes
demands on the reader. But Englishmen will rather agree with the
well-known eulogy of Coleridge: “<i>Feliciter audax</i> is the motto
for its style comparatively with that of Shakspere’s other works, even
as it is the general motto of all his works compared with those of
other poets. Be it remembered, too, that this happy valiancy of style
is but the representative and result of all the material excellences
so expressed.” But in any case, whether to be praised or blamed, it
is a typical example of Shakespeare’s final manner, the manner that
characterises <i>Coriolanus</i> and the Romances, and that shows itself
only occasionally or incompletely in his preceding works.</p>

<p>4. A consideration of the tone of the tragedy yields similar results.
It has been pointed out<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
that there is a gradual lightening in the atmosphere of Shakespeare’s
plays after the composition of <i>Othello</i> and <i>Lear</i>. In them,
and especially in the latter, we move in the deepest gloom. It is to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
them that critics point who read in Shakespeare a message of pessimism
and despair. And though there are not wanting, for those who will
see them, glimpses of comfort and hope even in their horror of thick
darkness, it must be owned that the misery and murder of Desdemona, the
torture and remorse of Othello, the persecution of Lear, the hanging
of Cordelia, are more harrowing and appalling than the heart can well
endure. But we are conscious of a difference in the others of the
group. Though Macbeth retains our sympathy to the last, his story does
not rouse our questionings as do the stories of these earlier victims.
We are well content that he should expiate his crimes, and that a
cleaner hand should inherit the sceptre: we recognise the justice of
the retribution and hail the dawn of better times. In <i>Coriolanus</i>
the feeling is not only of assent but of exultation. True, the tragedy
ends with the hero’s death, but that is no unmitigated evil. He has won
back something of his lost nobility and risen to the greatest height
his nature could attain, in renouncing his revenge: after that what was
there that he could live for either in Corioli or Rome?</p>

<p><i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> has points of contact with both these
plays, and shows like them that the night is on the wane. Of course
in one way the view of life is still disconsolate enough. The lust of
the flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of life: ambitious
egoism, uninspired craft and conventional propriety; these are the
forces that clash in this gorgeous mêlée of the West and the East. At
the outset passion holds the lists, then self-interest takes the lead,
but principle never has a chance. We think of Lucifera’s palace in the
<i>Faerie Queene</i>, with the seven deadly sins passing in arrogant
gala before the marble front, and with the shifting foundations
beneath, the dungeons and ruins at the rear. The superb shows of life
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
are displayed in all their superbness and in all their vanity. In the
end their worshippers are exposed as their dupes. Antony is a cloud
and a dream, Cleopatra no better than “a maid that milks and does the
meanest chares”: yet she sees that it is “paltry to be Caesar,” and
hears Antony mock at Caesar’s luck. Whatever the goal, it is a futile
one, and the objects of human desire are shown on their seamy side.
We seem to lose sight of ideals, and idealism would be out of place.
Even the passing reference to Shakespeare’s own art shows a dissipation
of the glamour. In <i>Julius Caesar</i> Brutus and Cassius had looked
forward to an immortality of glory on the stage and evidently regard
the theatre as equal to the highest demands, but now to Cleopatra it is
only an affair of vulgar makeshifts that parodies what it presents.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">I shall see</div>

    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 219.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In so far the impression produced is a cheerless
one, and Gervinus has gone so far as to say: “There is no great or
noble character among the personages, no really elevated feature in the
action of this drama whether in its politics or its love affairs.” This
is excessive: but it is true that, as in <i>Timon</i>, the suggestion
for which came from the same source and the composition of which may
be dated a short time before, no very spiritual note is struck and no
very dutiful figure is to the fore. And the background is a lurid one.
“A world-catastrophe!” says Dr. Brandes, “(Shakespeare) has no mind
now to write of anything else. What is sounding in his ears, what is
filling his thoughts, is the crash of a world falling in ruins.... The
might of Rome, stern and austere, shivered at the touch of Eastern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
voluptuousness. Everything sank, everything fell,—character and will,
dominions and principalities, men and women. Everything was worm-eaten,
serpent-bitten, poisoned by sensuality—everything tottered and collapsed.”</p>

<p>Yet though the sultry splendours of the scenes seem to blast rather
than foster, though the air is laden with pestilence, and none of the
protagonists has escaped the infection, the total effect is anything
but depressing. As in <i>Macbeth</i> we accept without demur the
penalty exacted for the offence. As in <i>Coriolanus</i> we welcome
the magnanimity that the offenders recover or achieve at the close. If
there is less of acquiescence in vindicated justice than in the first,
if there is less of elation at the triumph of the nobler self than in
the second, there is yet something of both. In this respect too it
seems to stand between them and we cannot be far wrong if we place it
shortly after the one and shortly before the other, near the end of 1607.</p>

<p>And that means too that it comes near the end of Shakespeare’s tragic
period, when his four chief tragedies were already composed and when
he was well aware of all the requirements of the tragic art. In his
quartet of masterpieces he was free to fulfil these requirements
without let or hindrance, for he was elaborating material that claimed
no particular reverence from him. But now he turns once more to
authorised history and in doing so once more submits to the limitations
that in his practice authorised history imposed. Why he did so it is
of course impossible to say. It was a famous story, accessible to
the English public in some form or other from the days of Chaucer’s
<i>Legend of Good Women</i>, and at an early age Shakespeare was
attracted by it, or at least was conversant with Cleopatra’s reputation
as one of the world’s paragons of beauty. In <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
Mercutio includes her in his list of those, Dido, Hero, Thisbe and the
rest, who in Romeo’s eyes are nothing to his Rosaline; compared with
that lady he finds “Cleopatra a gipsy.”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
And so indeed she was, for gipsy at first meant nothing else than
Egyptian, and Skelton, in his <i>Garland of Laurel</i>, swearing by St.
Mary of Egypt, exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">By Mary gipcy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quod scripsi scripsi.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But in current belief the black-haired, tawny
vagrants, who, from the commencement of the sixteenth century, despite
cruel enactments cruelly enforced, began to swarm into England, were of
Egyptian stock. And precisely in this there lay a paradox and riddle,
for according to conventional ideas they were anything but comely,
and yet it was a matter of common fame that a great Roman had thrown
away rule, honour and duty in reckless adoration of the queen of the
race. Perhaps Shakespeare had this typical instance in his mind when
in <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i> he talks of the madness of the lover
who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 11.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">For to the end the poet ignores the purity of
Cleopatra’s Greek descent, and seems by many touches to imagine her as
of the same type as those undesirable immigrants against whom the penal
laws were of so little avail. Nevertheless he accepts the fact of her
charm, and, in <i>As You Like It</i>, among the contributions which the
“Heavenly Synod” levied on the supreme examples of womankind for the
equipment of Rosalind, specifies “Cleopatra’s majesty.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
It is not the quality on which he was afterwards to lay stress, it is
not the quality that Plutarch accentuates, nor is it likely to have
been suggested by the gipsies he had seen. But there was another source
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
on which he may have drawn. Next to the story of Julius Caesar, the
story of Antony and Cleopatra was perhaps the prerogative Roman theme
among the dramatists of the sixteenth century<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
and was associated with such illustrious
personages as Jodelle and Garnier in France, and the Countess of
Pembroke and Daniel in England. It is, as we have seen, highly probable
that Shakespeare had read the versions of his compatriots at any rate,
and their dignified harangues are just of the kind to produce the
impression of loftiness and state.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Cleopatra was a familiar name to Shakespeare when he
began seriously to immerse himself in her history. We can understand
how it would stir his heart as it filled in and corrected his previous
vague surmises. What a revelation of her witchcraft would be that
glowing picture of her progress when, careless and calculating, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
condescended to obey the summons of the Roman conqueror and answer the
charge that she had helped Brutus in his campaign.</p>

<p class="blockquot">When she was sent unto by divers letters, both
from Antonius him selfe and also from his frendes, she made so light
of it, and mocked Antonius so much, that she disdained to set forward
otherwise, but to take her barge in the river of Cydnus, the poope
whereof was of gold, the sailes of purple, and the owers of silver,
which kept stroke in rowing after the sounde of the musicke of flutes,
howboyes, citherns, violls, and such other instruments as they played
upon in the barge. And now for the person of her selfe: she was layed
under a pavillion of cloth-of-gold of tissue, apparelled and attired
like the goddesse Venus, commonly drawen in picture: and hard by her,
on either hand of her, pretie faire boyes apparelled as painters doe
set forth god Cupide, with little fannes in their hands, with which
they fanned wind upon her. Her ladies and gentlewomen also, the fairest
of them were apparelled like the nymphes Nereides (which are the
mermaides of the waters) and like the Graces, some stearing the helme,
others tending the tackle and ropes of the barge, out of which there
came a wonderfull passing sweete savor of perfumes, that perfumed the
wharfes side pestered<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
with innumerable multitudes of people. Some of them followed the barge
all alongest the rivers side: others also ranne out of the citie to
see her comming in. So that in the end, there ranne such multitudes of
people one after an other to see her, that Antonius was left post alone
in the market place, in his Imperiall seate to geve audience: and there
went a rumor in the peoples mouthes that the goddesse Venus was come to
play with the god Bacchus,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
for the generall good of all Asia. When Cleopatra landed, Antonius sent
to invite her to supper with him. But she sent him word againe, he
should doe better rather to come and suppe with her. Antonius therefore
to shew him selfe curteous unto her at her arrivall, was contented
to obey her, and went to supper to her: where he found such passing
sumptuous fare that no tongue can expresse it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
But it was not only the prodigality of charm that would enthral the
poet. In the relation of the lovers, in the character of Cleopatra, in
the nature of her ascendancy, there is something that reminds us of
the story of passion enshrined in the <i>Sonnets</i>. No doubt it is
uncertain whether these in detail are to be regarded as biographical,
but biographical they are at the core, at least in the sense that they
are authentic utterance of feelings actually experienced. No doubt,
too, the balance of evidence points to their composition, at least in
the parts that deal with his unknown leman, early in Shakespeare’s
career; but for that very reason the memories would be fitter to
help him in interpreting the poetry of the historical record, for as
Wordsworth says: “Poetry is emotion recollected in tranquillity.” So
once more Shakespeare may have been moved to “make old offences of
affections new,” that is, to infuse the passion of his own youth into
this tale of “old unhappy far-off things.” His bygone sorrows of the
<i>Sonnets</i> come back to him when he is writing the drama, mirror
themselves in some of the situations and sentiments, and echo in the
wording of a few of the lines. It is of course easy to exaggerate the
importance of these reminiscences. The Dark Lady has been described
as the original of Cleopatra, but the original of Cleopatra is the
Cleopatra of Plutarch, and in many ways she is unlike the temptress
of the poet. She is dowered with a marvellous beauty which all from
Enobarbus to Octavius acknowledge, while the other is “foul” in all
eyes save those of her lover; her face “hath not the power to make love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
groan”; and in her there is no hint of Cleopatra’s royalty of soul.
Nor is the devotion of Antony the devotion of the sonneteer; it is far
more absolute and unquestioning, it is also far more comrade-like and
sympathetic; at first he exults in it without shame, and never till
the last distracted days does suspicion or contempt enter his heart.
Still less is his passing spasm of jealousy at the close like the
chronic jealousy of the poet. It is a vengeful frenzy that must find
other outlets as well as the self-accusing remonstrances and impotent
rebukes of the lyrical complaints. The resemblance between sonnets and
play is confined to the single feature that they both tell the story
of an unlawful passion for a dark woman—for this was Shakespeare’s
fixed idea in regard to Cleopatra—whose character and reputation
were stained, whose influence was pernicious, and whose fatal spells
depended largely on her arts and intellect. But this was enough to
give Shakespeare, as it were, a personal insight into the case, and a
personal interest in it, to furnish him with the key of the situation
and place him at the centre.</p>

<p>And there was another point of contact between the author and the hero
of the tragedy. It is stated in Plutarch’s account of Antony: “Some say
that he lived three and fiftie yeares: and others say six and fiftie.”
But the action begins a decade, or (for, as we shall see, there is a
jumbling of dates in the opening scenes like that which we have noted
in the corresponding ones of <i>Julius Caesar</i>) more than a decade
before the final catastrophe. Thus Shakespeare would imagine Antony
at the outset as between forty-two and forty-six, practically on the
same <i>niveau</i> of life as himself, for in 1607-1608 he was in his
forty-fourth year. They had reached the same stadium in their career,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
had the same general outlook on the future, had their great triumphs
behind them, and yet with powers hardly impaired they both could say,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There would be a general sympathy of attitude,
and it even extends to something in the poet himself analogous to
the headlong ardour of Antony. In the years that had elapsed since
Shakespeare gave the first instalment of his story in <i>Julius
Caesar</i>, a certain change had been proceeding in his art. The
present drama belongs to a different epoch of his authorship, an epoch
not of less force but of less restrained force, an epoch when he
works perhaps with less austerity of stroke and less intellectualism,
but—strange that it should be so in advancing years—with more
abandonment to the suggestions of imagination and passion. In all these
respects the fortunes of Antony and Cleopatra would offer him a fit
material. In the second as compared with the first Roman play, there is
certainly no decline. The subject is different, the point of view is
different, the treatment is different, but subject, point of view and
treatment all harmonise with each other, and the whole in its kind is
as great as could be.</p>

<p>Perhaps some such considerations may explain why Shakespeare, after
he had been for seven years expatiating on the heights of free tragic
invention, yet returned for a time to a theme which, with his ideas
of loyalty to recorded fact, dragged him back in some measure to the
embarrassments of the chronicle history. It was all so congenial, that
he was willing to face the disadvantages of an action that straggled
over years and continents, of a multiplicity of short scenes that in
the third act rise to a total of thirteen and in the fourth to a total
of fifteen, of a number of episodic personages who appear without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
preparation and vanish almost without note. He had to lay his account
with this if he dramatised these transactions at all, for to him they
were serious matters that his fancy must not be allowed to distort.
Indeed he accepts the conditions so unreservedly, and makes so little
effort to evade them, that his mind seems to have taken the ply, and
he resorts to the meagre, episodical scene, not only when Plutarch’s
narrative suggests it, but when he is making additions of his own and
when no very obvious advantage is to be secured. This is the only
explanation that readily presents itself for the fourth scene of
the second act, which in ten lines describes Lepidus’ leave-taking
of Mecaenas and Agrippa.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
There is for this no authority in the <i>Life</i>; and what object does
it serve? It may indicate on the one hand the punctilious deference
that Octavius’ ministers deem fit to show as yet to the incompetent
Triumvir, and on the other his lack of efficient energy in allowing his
private purposes to make him two days late at the <i>rendezvous</i>
which he himself has advocated as urgent. But these hints could quite
well have been conveyed in some other way, and this invented scene
seems theatrically and dramatically quite otiose. Nevertheless, and
this is the point to observe, it so fits into the pattern of the
chronicle play that it does not force itself on one’s notice as superfluous.</p>

<p>It is partly for this reason that <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> holds its
distinctive place among Shakespeare’s masterpieces. On the one hand
there is no play that springs more spontaneously out of the heart of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
its author, and into which he has breathed a larger portion of his
inspiration; and on the other there is none that is more purely
historical, so that in this respect it is comparable among the Roman
dramas to <i>Richard II.</i> in the English series. This was the
double characteristic that Coleridge emphasised in his <i>Notes on
Shakespeare’s Plays</i>: “There is not one in which he has followed
history so minutely, and yet there are few in which he impresses the
notion of angelic strength so much—perhaps none in which he impresses
it more strongly. This is greatly owing to the manner in which the
fiery force is sustained throughout, and to the numerous momentary
flashes of nature counteracting the historical abstraction.” The
angelic strength, the fiery force, the flashes of nature are due to his
complete sympathy with the facts, but that makes his close adherence to
his authority all the more remarkable.</p>

</div>

<p>The obligations to Plutarch, though very great, are of a somewhat
peculiar kind. Shakespeare does not borrow so largely or so repeatedly
from the diction of North as in <i>Coriolanus</i> or even in <i>Julius
Caesar</i>. His literal indebtedness is for the most part confined to
the exploitation here and there of a few short phrases or sentences,
generally of a not very distinctive character. Thus Octavia is
described as “having an excellent grace, wisedom and honestie, joined
unto so rare a beawtie”; which suggests her “beauty, wisdom, modesty,”
in the play (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> ii. 246). Thus, after the
scourging of Thyreus, Antony sends Caesar the message:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
“If this mislike thee,” said he, “thou hast Hipparchus<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
one of my infranchised bondmen with thee: hang him if thou wilt, or
whippe him at thy pleasure, that we may cry quittaunce.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">This becomes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent22">If he mislike</div>
<div class="verse indent0">My speech and what is done, tell him he has</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Hipparchus, my enfranchised bondman, whom</div>
<div class="verse indent0">He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">As he shall like, to quit me.</div>
<div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 147.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
So, too, Plutarch says of Dolabella’s disclosure to Cleopatra:</p>

<p class="blockquot">He sent her word secretly as she had requested
him, that Caesar determined to take his journey through Suria, and that
within three dayes he would sende her away before with her children.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The words are closely copied in Dolabella’s statement:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent17">Caesar through Syria</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Intends his journey, and within three days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You with your children will he send before:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make your best use of this: I have perform’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your pleasure and my promise.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 200.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is only now and then that such small loans stand out as examples
of the “happy valiancy of style” that characterises the drama as a
whole. For instance, at the end when Cleopatra is dead and Charmian has
applied the asp, the brief interchange of question and answer which
Plutarch reports could not be bettered even by Shakespeare.</p>

<p class="blockquot">One of the souldiers seeing her, angrily sayd unto
her: “Is that well done, Charmion?” “Verie well,” sayd she againe, “and
meete for a Princes discended from a race of so many noble Kings.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare knows when he is well off and accepts
the goods the gods provide.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>1st Guard.</i><span class="ws2">Charmian, is this well done?</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent34">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 238.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Perhaps the noblest and one of the closest of
these paraphrases is in the scene of Antony’s death. With his last
breath he persuades her</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">that she should not lament nor sorowe
for the miserable chaunge of his fortune at the end of his dayes: but
rather that she should thinke him the more fortunate, for the former
triumphes and honors he had received, considering that while he lived
he was the noblest and greatest Prince of the world, and that now he
was overcome, not cowardly but valiantly, a Romane by an other Romane.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
Shakespeare’s Antony says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The miserable change now at my end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lament nor sorrow at: but please your thoughts</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o’ the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noblest: and do now not basely die,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not cowardly put off my helmet to</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xv. 51.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">As a rule, however, even these short reproductions
are not transcripts. Shakespeare’s usual method is illustrated in his
recast of Antony’s pathetic protest to Caesar that</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">he made him angrie with him, bicause he
shewed him selfe prowde and disdainfull towards him, and now specially
when he was easie to be angered, by reason of his present miserie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare gives a more bitter poignancy
to the confession.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">Look, thou say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He makes me angry with him, for he seems</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Proud and disdainful, <i>harping on what I am,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry</i>;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And at this time most easy ’tis to do ’t,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>When my good stars, that were my former guides,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Into the abysm of hell</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 140.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Much the same estimate holds good of the longer
passages derived from North, which for the rest are but few. The most
literal are as a rule comparatively unimportant. A typical specimen is
the list of complaints made by Antony against Octavius, and Octavius’
rejoinder:</p>

<p class="blockquot">And the chiefest poyntes of his accusations
he charged him with, were these: First, that having spoyled Sextus
Pompeius in Sicile, he did not give him his parte of the Ile. Secondly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
that he did deteyne in his handes the shippes he lent him to make that
warre. Thirdly, that having put Lepidus their companion and triumvirate
out of his part of the Empire, and having deprived him of all honors:
he retayned for him selfe the lands and revenues thereof, which had
been assigned to him for his part.... Octavius Caesar aunswered him
againe: that for Lepidus, he had in deede deposed him, and taken
his part of the Empire from him, bicause he did overcruelly use his
authoritie. And secondly, for the conquests he had made by force of
armes, he was contented Antonius should have his part of them, so that
he would likewise let him have his part of Armenia.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare copies even Caesar’s convenient
reticence as to the borrowed vessels.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Less matter-of-fact, because more vibrant with
its fanfare of names, but still somewhat of the nature of an official
schedule, is the list of tributaries in Antony’s host.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(He) had with him to ayde him these kinges
and subjects following: Bocchus king of Lybia, Tarcondemus king
of high Cilicia, Archelaus king of Cappadocia, Philadelphus king
of Paphlagonia, Mithridates king of Comagena, and Adallas king of
Thracia. All the which were there every man in person. The residue
that were absent sent their armies, as Polemon king of Pont, Manchus
king of Arabia, Herodes king of Iury; and furthermore, Amyntas king of
Lycaonia, and of the Galatians: and besides all these he had all the
ayde the king of Medes sent unto him.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
The long bead-roll of shadowy potentates evidently delights
Shakespeare’s ear as it would have delighted the ear of Milton or
Victor Hugo<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Still, of the longer passages that show throughout
a real approximation to North’s language, the two already quoted,
the soothsayer’s warning to Antony, and the description of Cleopatra
on the Cydnus are the most impressive: and even they, and especially
the latter, have been touched up and revised. Shakespeare’s general
procedure in the cases where he borrows at all is a good deal freer,
and may be better illustrated from the passage in which Octavius
recalls the bygone fortitude of Antony.</p>

<p class="blockquot">These two Consuls (Hircius and Pansa) together
with Caesar, who also had an armye, went against Antonius that beseeged
the citie of Modena, and there overthrew him in battell: but both the
Consuls were slaine there. Antonius flying upon this overthrowe, fell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
into great miserie all at once: but the chiefest want of all other,
and that pinched him most, was famine. Howbeit he was of such a strong
nature, that by pacience he would overcome any adversitie, and the
heavier fortune lay upon him, the more constant shewed he him selfe....
It was a wonderfull example to the souldiers, to see Antonius that was
brought up in all finenes and superfluitie, so easily to drink puddle
water, and to eate wild frutes and rootes: and moreover it is reported,
that even as they passed the Alpes, they did eate the barcks of trees,
and such beasts, as never man tasted of their flesh before.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This is good, but Shakespeare’s version visualises
as well as heightens Antony’s straits and endurance, and brings them
into contrast with his later effeminacy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">When thou once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Though daintily brought up, with patience more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The roughest berry on the rudest hedge:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But including such elaborations, the number of
passages repeated or recast from North is not considerable. In the
whole of the first act this description of the retreat from Modena is
the only one of any consequence, and though the percentage increases
as the play proceeds, and they are much more frequent in the second
half, even in the fifth act, the proportion of easily traceable lines
is fifty-seven to four hundred and forty-six, or barely more than an
eighth.</p>

<p>Much more numerous and generally much more noteworthy than the strictly
verbal suggestions are those that, conveyed altogether in Shakespeare’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
phrase, give such immediate life to the play, whether they supply
episodes for acting or merely material for the dialogue. Sometimes a
whole paragraph is distilled into a sentence, like that famous bit of
domestic chit-chat that must have impressed Plutarch when a boy.</p>

<p class="blockquot">I have heard my grandfather Lampryas report, that
one Philotas a Physition, born in the citie of Amphissa, told him that
he was at the present time in Alexandria, and studied physicke: and
that having acquaintance with one of Antonius cookes, he tooke him with
him to Antonius house, (being a young man desirous to see things) to
shew him the wonderfull sumptuous charge and preparation of one only
supper. When he was in the kitchin, and saw a world of diversities of
meates, and amongst others eight wilde boares rosted whole: he began
to wonder at it, and sayd, “Sure you have a great number of ghestes
to supper.” The cooke fell a-laughing, and answered him: “No,” (quoth
he), “not many ghestes, nor above twelve in all: but yet all that is
boyled or roasted must be served in whole, or else it would be marred
straight. For Antonius peradventure will suppe presently, or it may be
in a pretie while hence, or likely enough he will deferre it longer,
for that he hath dronke well to-day, or else hath had some other great
matters in hand: and therefore we doe not dresse one supper only, but
many suppers, bicause we are uncerteine of the houre he will suppe in.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">In what strange ways has the gossip of the
inquisitive medical student been transmitted through Lampryas and his
grandchild to furnish an arabesque for Shakespeare’s tapestry! And,
when we know its history, what a realistic touch does this anecdote
lend to Mecaenas’ badinage, though Shakespeare has raised the profuse
to the sublime by transferring the banquet from the evening to the
morning, suppressing the fact of the relays, and insinuating that this
was nothing out of the common!</p>

Or again we are told of Cleopatra’s precautions after Actium.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now to make proofe of those poysons which made men

as were more milde and gentle, had not that quicke speede and force

stinging of snakes and adders, and made some to be applied unto men in
her sight, some in one sorte, and some in an other. So when she had
dayly made divers and sundrie proofes, she found none of all them she
had proved so fit as the biting of an Aspicke, the which only causeth
a heavines of the head, without swounding or complaining, and bringeth

her indignation at him and apology to Octavius, Octavius’ reception
of it, Dolabella’s sympathy with the captive queen, the arrival of
the countryman with the figs, the dressing in state, the death of
Cleopatra and Iras before the soldiers enter, Charmian’s last service
in adjusting the diadem, Octavius’ appreciation of Cleopatra’s courage
and command for her burial beside Antony.</p>

<p>This enumeration shows how largely Shakespeare is indebted to Plutarch,
and also how his obligations are greatest in the later portion of the
play. They become conspicuous a little before the middle of the third
act, and the proportion is maintained till the close; for though there
are not so many in the fifth act, it is considerably shorter than the
fourth or than the last eight scenes of the third.</p>

<p>Shakespeare however obtains from Plutarch not merely a large number
of his details, but the general programme of the story and the
presuppositions of the portraiture, as will appear from a short summary
of Plutarch’s narrative, into which, for clearness’ sake, I insert the
principal dates.</p>

<p>After Philippi, Antony gave himself up to a life of ostentation and
luxury, interrupted by flashes of his nobler mood, first in Greece
and subsequently in Asia. Then came his meeting with Cleopatra on the
Cydnus, and in his passion for her all that was worthiest in his nature
was smothered. Despite pressing public duties he accompanied her on her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
return to Alexandria, where he wasted his time in “childish sports
and idle pastimes.” In the midst of his dalliance the tidings arrive
with which the play opens, in 41 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, of the
contest of his brother Lucius and his wife Fulvia, first with each
other and then with Octavius, of their defeat and expulsion from Italy;
as well as of the inroad of the Parthians under Labienus as far as
Lydia and Ionia.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Then began Antonius with much a doe to rouse him
selfe as if he had been wakened out of a deepe sleepe, and as a man may
say comming out of a great dronkennes.</p>

<p class="no-indent">He sets out for Parthia, but in obedience
to the urgent summons of Fulvia, changes his course for Italy.
On the way he falls in with fugitives of his party who tell him
that his wife was sole cause of the war and had begun it only to
withdraw him from Cleopatra. Soon afterwards Fulvia, who was “going
to meete with Antonius” fell sick and died at Sicyon in 40
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>—“by good fortune” comments Plutarch,
as now the colleagues could be more easily reconciled. The friends of
both were indisposed to “unrippe any olde matters” and a composition
was come to whereby Antony obtained the East, Octavius the West, and
Lepidus Africa. This agreement, since Antony was now a widower and
“denied not that he kept Cleopatra, but so did he not confesse that he
had her as his wife,” was confirmed by Antony’s marriage, which every
one approved, with Octavius’ dearly loved half-sister Octavia, and
it was hoped that “she should be a good meane to keepe good love and
amitie betwext her brother and him.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sextus Pompeius in Sicily had been making himself
troublesome with his pirate allies, and as he had showed great courtesy
to Antony’s mother, it seemed good to make peace with him. An interview
accordingly took place at Misenum in 39 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
as a result of which he was granted Sicily and Sardinia on the
conditions mentioned in the play.</p>

<p>Antony was now able to resume his plans for punishing the Parthians and
sent Ventidius against them while he still remained in Rome. But moved
by the predominance of Octavius and the warning of the soothsayer,
he resolved to take up his own jurisdiction, and with Octavia and
their infant daughter set out for Greece, where he heard the news of
Ventidius’ success in 38 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>In 37 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, offended at some reports,
he returned to Italy with Octavia, who had now a second daughter and
was again with child. By her intercession good relations were restored
between the brothers-in-law, each lending the other the forces of which
he most stood in need. Octavius employed the borrowed ships against Sextus
Pompeius, Antony was to employ the borrowed soldiers against the Parthians.</p>

<p>Leaving his wife and children in Octavius’ care, Antony proceeded
directly to Asia.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Then beganne this pestilent plague and mischiefe
of Cleopatraes love (which had slept a longe tyme and seemed to have
bene utterlie forgotten and that Antonius had geven place to better
counsell) againe to kindle and to be in force, so soone as Antonius
came neere unto Syria.</p>

<p class="no-indent">He sends for her and to the scandal of the Romans
pays her extravagant honours, showers kingdoms upon her, and designates
their twin children the Sun and the Moon.</p>

<p>He does not, however, in seeming, neglect his expedition to Parthia,
but gathers a huge and well appointed host wherewith to invade it.
Nevertheless</p>

<p class="blockquot">this so great and puisant army which made the
Indians quake for feare, dwelling about the contry of the Bactrians and
all Asia also to tremble: served him to no purpose, and all for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
love he bore to Cleopatra. For the earnest great desire he had to lye
all winter with her, made him begin his warre out of due time, and for
hast to put all in hazard, being so ravished and enchaunted with the
sweete poyson of her love, that he had no other thought but of her, and
how he might quickly returne againe: more then how he might overcome
his enemies.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Not only did Antony choose the wrong season, but
in his hurry he left all his heavy engines behind him and thus threw
away his chances in advance. The campaign was a series of disasters
and ended in an inglorious retreat. The only credit that can be given
to him from beginning to end is for efficiency in misfortune and
sympathy with his soldiers. Yet even these were impaired by his fatal
passion.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The greate haste he made to returne unto
Cleopatra, caused him to put his men to great paines, forcing them to
lye in the field all winter long when it snew unreasonably, that by the
way he lost eight thowsand of his men.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Arrived at the Syrian coast he awaits her
coming.</p>

<p class="blockquot">And bicause she taried longer then he would have
had her, he pined away for love and sorrow. So that he was at such a
straight, that he wist not what to doe, and therefore to weare it out,
he gave him selfe to quaffing and feasting. But he was so drowned with
the love of her, that he could not abide to sit at the table till the
feast were ended: but many times while others banketted, he came to the
sea side to see if she were comming.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Meanwhile, in 36 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
during the Parthian expedition, Sextus Pompeius had been defeated,
his death, not mentioned by Plutarch, following in the ensuing year,
and Lepidus had been deposed by Octavius, who gave no account of the
spoils. On the other hand, in 34 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
Antony, who had overrun and seized Armenia, celebrated his triumph not
in Rome but in Alexandria.</p>

<p>Grievances were thus accumulating on both sides, and Octavia once more
seeking to mediate, took ship to join her husband with the approval of
Octavius, who foresaw the upshot, and regarded it as likely to put his
brother-in-law in the wrong.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>Antony bade her stop at Athens, promising to come to her, but
afterwards, fearing lest Cleopatra should kill herself for grief,
he broke tryst, and Octavia returned to Rome where she watched over
his interests as best she might. Antony in the meantime accompanied
Cleopatra to Egypt and gave the Romans new offence by paying her divine
honours and parcelling out the East among her and her children.</p>

<p>Then came the interchange of uncompromising messages in 33
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and Antony bade Octavia leave his house.
The appeal to arms was inevitable, and as the taxation to which Octavius
was compelled to resort in view of his rival’s great preparation
roused general discontent, it was Antony’s cue to invade Italy. But he
continued to squander his time in feasts and revels, and in such and
other ways further alienated his friends in Rome.</p>

<p>In 32 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Octavius declared war
against Cleopatra, and had Antony deprived of his authority.
The battle of Actium followed on the 2nd September, 31 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
But Antony, after his retirement to Egypt, in some measure recovered
from his first despondency at the defeat, and even when he found
himself forsaken by allies and troops, continued to live a life of
desperate gaiety. After an ignominious attempt at negotiation and
a flicker of futile success, the final desertion of his fleet, for
which he blamed Cleopatra, put an end to his resistance, and he
killed himself in 30 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, less, however,
in despair at his overthrow than for grief at Cleopatra’s alleged death.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(He) said unto him selfe: “What doest thou looke
for further, Antonius, sith spitefull fortune hath taken from thee the
only joy thou haddest, for whom thou yet reservedst thy life.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">After mentioning how Antony’s son, Antyllus, and
Cleopatra’s son, Caesarion, were betrayed to death by their governors,
Plutarch describes how Cleopatra for a while is deterred from suicide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
chiefly by fears for her other children. Hearing, however, Octavius’
definite plans for her, she obtains leave to offer a last oblation
at Antony’s tomb, and thereafter takes her own life. The biography
concludes with a notice of Octavia’s care for all Antony’s children,
not only Fulvia’s and her own, but those of whom Cleopatra was mother.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this sketch that no incidents of political
importance are added, few are altered, and very few omitted by
Shakespeare. Of course the dramatic form necessitates a certain
concentration, and this of itself, even were there no farther motive,
would account for the occasional synchronising of separate episodes.
Thus the news of Fulvia’s death and Sextus Pompeius’ aggression is
run together with the news of the wars of Fulvia and Lucius and the
advance of the Parthians. Thus between the second marriage and the
final breach it was convenient to condense matters, and, in doing
this, to omit Antony’s flying visit to Italy, blend Octavia’s first
and second attempts at mediation, and represent her as taking leave of
her husband at Athens. In the same way the months between the battle
of Actium and the death of Antony, and the days between the death of
Antony and that of Cleopatra might easily be compressed without any
hurt to the sentiment of the story. But even of this artistic license
Shakespeare avails himself far less systematically than in <i>Julius
Caesar</i>. There, as we saw, the action is crowded into five days,
though with considerable intervals between some of them. There is no
such arrangement in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>. Superficially this
play is one of the most invertebrate in structure that Shakespeare
ever wrote. It gives one the impression of an anxious desire to avoid
tampering with the facts and their relations even when history does not
furnish ready-made the material that bests fits the drama.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span></p>

<p>And in the main this impression is correct. Shakespeare supplies a
panorama of some ten eventful years in which he can not only cite his
chapter and verse for most of the official <i>data</i>, but reproduces,
with amazing fidelity, the general contour of the historical landscape,
in so far as it was visible from his point of view. And yet his
allegiance to the letter has often been exaggerated and is to a
great extent illusory. This does not mean merely that his picture
fails to approve itself as the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, when tested by the investigations of modern scholars.
His position and circumstances were not theirs. He took Plutarch’s
<i>Marcus Antonius</i> as his chief and almost sole authority,
resorting possibly for suggestions of situation and phrase to the
Senecan tragedies on the same theme, probably for the descriptions of
Egypt to Holland’s translation of Pliny or Cory’s translation of Leo,
and almost certainly for many details about Sextus Pompeius<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
to the 1578 version of Appian; but always treating the <i>Life</i> not only
as his inexhaustible storehouse, but as sufficient guarantee for any
statement that it contained. In short he could give the history of the
time, not as it was but as Plutarch represented it, and as Plutarch’s
representation explained itself to an Elizabethan. It is hardly to
his discredit if he underestimates Cleopatra’s political astuteness,
and has no guess of the political projects that recent criticism has
ascribed to Antony, for of these things his author has little to say.
It is hardly to his credit, if, on Appian’s hint, he realises the
importance of Sextus Pompeius’ insular position and naval power, for he
lived in the days of Hawkins and Drake.</p>

<p>But he is not slavishly literal even in his adherence to Plutarch. He
adopts his essential and many of his subsidiary facts: he follows his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
lead in the broad course of events; he does not alter the main lines of
the story. But it is surprising to find how persistently he rearranges
and regroups the minor details, and how by this means he gives them
a new significance. The portions of the play where he has made the
narrative more compact are also, roughly speaking, those in which he
has taken most liberties in dislocating the sequence, and the result
is not merely greater conciseness but an original interpretation.
Yet on the other hand we must not either misconstrue the meaning or
overstate the importance of this procedure. In the first place it
affects not so much the history of events as the portraiture of the
persons. In the second place, even in the characterisation it generally
adds vividness and depth to the presentation rather than alters the
fundamental traits. Thus in Plutarch the soothsayer’s warning to
Antony follows, in Shakespeare it precedes, the composition with
Pompey. From the chronicler’s point of view this transposition is
abundantly unimportant, but it does make a difference in our estimate
of Antony: his consequent decision shows more levity and rashness in
the play than in the biography. Yet in both his whole behaviour at this
juncture is distinctly fickle and indiscreet; so the net result of the
displacement is to sharpen the lines that Plutarch has already drawn.
And this is true in a greater or less degree of most of the cases in
which Shakespeare reshuffles Plutarch’s notes. On the whole, despite
dramatic parallax and changed perspective, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>
is astonishingly faithful to the facts as they were supposed to be.
Shakespeare could hardly have done more in getting to the heart of
Plutarch’s account, and in reconstructing it with all its vital and
essential characteristics disentangled and combined afresh in their
rational connection. And since after all Plutarch “meant right” this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
implies that Shakespeare is not only true to Plutarch, but virtually
true to what is still considered the spirit of his subject.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Indeed his most far-reaching modifications concern in the main the
manner in which the persons appeal to our sympathies, and in which he
wishes us to envisage their story; and these perhaps in a preliminary
view can better be indicated by what he has suppressed than by what he
has added or recast. There is one conspicuous omission that shows how
he deals with character; there are several minor ones that in their sum
show how he prescribes the outlook.</p>

<p>To begin with the former, it is impossible not to be struck by the
complete deletion of the Parthian fiasco, which in Plutarch occupies
nearly a fifth of the whole <i>Life</i>, or a fourth of the part with
which Shakespeare deals in this play. It thus bulks large in Antony’s
career, and though in the main it may be unsuitable for dramatic
purposes, it is nevertheless connected in its beginning, conduct and
close, with the story of his love for Cleopatra. Yet we have only one
far off and euphemistic reference to it in the words of Eros, when
Antony bids him strike.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">The gods withhold me!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,</div>

    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xiv. 69.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Why this reticence in regard to one of the most
ambitious enterprises with which the name of Antony was associated? The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
truth is that the whole management of the campaign detracts grievously
from the glamour of “absolute soldiership” with which the dramatist
surrounds his hero and through which he wishes us to view him. His
silence in regard to it is thus a hint of one far-reaching and
momentous change Shakespeare has made in the impression the story
conveys, and that is in the character of Antony himself. In the
biography he is by no means so grandiose a figure, so opulent and
magnificent a nature, as he appears in the play. Gervinus sums up the
salient features of Plutarch’s Antony in the following sentence:</p>

<p class="blockquot">A man who had grown up in the wild companionship
of a Curio and a Clodius, who had gone through the high school of
debauchery in Greece and Asia, who had shocked everybody in Rome during
Caesar’s dictatorship by his vulgar excesses, who had made himself
popular among the soldiers by drinking with them and encouraging
their low amours, a man upon whom the odium of the proscriptions
under the rule of the triumvirate especially fell, who displayed a
cannibal pleasure over Cicero’s bloody head and hand, who afterwards
renewed in the East the wanton life of his youth, and robbed in grand
style to maintain the vilest gang of parasites and jugglers, such a
man depicted finally as the prey of an elderly and artful courtesan,
could not possibly have been made the object of dramatic interest. It
is wonderful how Shakespeare on the one hand preserved the historic
features of Antony’s character, so as not to make him unrecognisable,
and yet how he contrived on the other to render him an attractive personage.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The array of charges Gervinus compiles from
Plutarch is not exaggerated. Indeed it could be enlarged and
emphasised. Dishonesty in money matters, jealousy of his subordinates,
an occasional lack of generalship that almost becomes inefficiency,
might be added to the list. But Plutarch’s picture contains other
traits that he does not seek to reconcile with those that repel us,
but drops in casually and by the way: and in Shakespeare these are
brought to the front. Valour, endurance, generosity, versatility,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
resourcefulness, self-knowledge, frankness, simplicity after a
fashion, width of outlook, power of self-recovery, are all attributed
to Antony even by his first biographer, though these qualities are
overweighted by the mass of his delinquencies. Shakespeare shows them
in relief; while the more offensive characteristics, like his youthful
licentiousness, are relegated to his bygone past, or, like his jealousy
and vindictiveness, are merely suggested by subordinate strokes, such
as the break in Ventidius’ triumphant campaign, or the merciless
scourging of Thyreus. It is sometimes said that Shakespeare’s Brutus
is historically correct and that his Mark Antony is a new creation.
The opposite statement would be nearer the truth. We feel that both
the biographer and the dramatist have given a portrait of Cleopatra’s
lover, and that both portraits are like; but the one painter has been
content with a collection of vivid traits which in their general effect
are ignoble and repulsive: the other in a sense has idealised his
model, but it is by reading the soul of greatness through the sordid
details, and explaining them by the conception of Antony, not perhaps
at his best but at his grandest. He is still, though fallen, the Antony
who at Caesar’s death could alter the course of history; a dissolute
intriguer no doubt, but a man of genius, a man of enthusiasms, one
who is equal or all but equal to the highest occasion the world
can present, and who, if he fails owing to the lack of steadfast
principle and virile will that results from voluptuous indulgence and
unscrupulous practisings, yet remains fascinating and magnificent even
in his ruin. And by means of this transfiguration, Shakespeare is able
to lend absorbing interest to his delineation of this gifted, complex,
and faulty soul, and to rouse the deepest sympathy for his fate.
Despite his loyalty to the historical record he lifts his argument
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
above the level of the Chronicle History, and makes it a true tragedy.
In its deference for facts, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> is to be ranked
with such pieces as <i>Richard II.</i> and <i>Henry VIII.</i>, but in
its real essence it claims another position. “The highest praise, or
rather the highest form of praise, of this play,” says Coleridge, “is
the doubt which the perusal always occasions in me, whether <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> is not, in all exhibitions of a giant power in its
strength and vigour of maturity, a formidable rival of <i>Macbeth</i>,
<i>Lear</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, and <i>Othello</i>.”</p>

<p>In another aspect the more obvious of the minor omissions are in their
general tendency not less typical of the way in which Shakespeare deals
with his subject. For what are those that strike us at first sight?
To begin with, many instances of Octavia’s devotion, constancy and
principle are passed over, and she is placed very much in the shade.
Then there is no reference to the children that sprang from her union
with Antony, indeed their existence is by implication denied, and she
seems to be introduced as another Iseult of the White Hands. Antony
cries to Cleopatra,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Have I my pillow left unpress’d in Rome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forborne the getting of a lawful race,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">By one that looks on feeders?</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 106.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Further, the tragic stories of Antony’s son
Antyllus and of Cleopatra’s son Caesarion are left unused, Antyllus not
being mentioned at all, Caesarion only by the way; though Daniel does
not scruple to include both accessories within the narrower limits of
a Senecan tragedy. More noticeable still, however, is the indifference
with which the children of Antony and Cleopatra are dismissed. They are
barely alluded to, though the Queen’s anxiety for their preservation,
which supplies acceptable matter not only to Daniel but to Jodelle and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
Garnier, is avouched by Plutarch’s statement and driven home by North’s
vigorous phrase. Plutarch describes her distress of body and mind after
Antony’s death and her own capture.</p>

<p class="blockquot">She fell into a fever withal: whereof she was very
glad, hoping thereby to have good colour to absteine from meate, and
that so she might have dyed easely without any trouble.... But Caesar
mistrusted the matter, by many conjectures he had, and therefore did
put her in feare, and threatned her to put her children to shameful
death. With these threats Cleopatra for feare yelded straight, <i>as
she would have yelded unto strokes</i>; and afterwards suffred her
selfe to be cured and dieted as they listed.</p>

<p>Shakespeare makes no use of this save in the warning of Octavius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">If you seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lay on me a cruelty, by taking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Antony’s course, you shall bereave yourself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of my good purposes, and put your children</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To that destruction which I’ll guard them from,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thereon you rely.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 128.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But here the threat is significant of Octavius’
character, not of Cleopatra’s, who makes no reply to it, and remains
absolutely unaffected by it. Indeed she shows more sense of motherhood
in her dying reference to the asp as “her baby at her breast,” than in
all the previous play.</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted that the effect of all these omissions is to
concentrate the attention on the purely personal relations of the
lovers. And the prominence assigned to them also appears if we compare
the <i>Life</i> and the drama as a whole.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in direct quotation, in incident and allusion,
in general structure, Shakespeare owes far more to his authority in
the last half of the play than in the first: for the closer observance
of, and the larger loans from, the biography begin with the central
scenes of the third act. But it is at this stage of the narrative that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
Cleopatra, for a while in the background, once more becomes the
paramount person; and few are the allusions to her from the period
of Actium that Shakespeare suffers to escape him. Moreover such
independent additions as there are in the latter portion of the
play, have mostly to do with her; and in six of the invented scenes
in the earlier acts she has the chief or at least a leading role.
Clearly, when she is in evidence, Shakespeare feels least need to
supplement, and when she is absent he has to fill in the gap. And this
is significant of his whole conception. Gervinus tries to express the
contrast between the Antony of Plutarch and the Antony of Shakespeare
by means of a comparison. “We are inclined,” he writes, “to designate
the ennobling transformation which the poet undertook by one word:
he refined the crude features of Mark Antony into the character of
an Alcibiades.” In a way that is not ill said, so far as it goes;
but it omits perhaps the most essential point. The great thing about
Shakespeare’s Antony is his capacity for a grand passion. We cannot
talk of Alcibiades as a typical lover in the literature of the world,
but Antony has a good right to his place in the “Seintes Legende of
Cupyde.” When three-quarters of a century after Shakespeare Dryden
ventured to rehandle the theme in the noble play that almost justifies
the audacity of his attempt, he called his version, <i>All for Love
or the World well lost</i>. We have something of the same feeling
in reading Shakespeare, and we do not have it in reading Plutarch.
Plutarch has no eyes for the glory of Antony’s madness. He gives
the facts or traditions that Shakespeare reproduced, but he regards
the whole affair as a pitiable dotage, or, at best, as a calamitous
visitation—regards it in short much as the Anti-Shakesperians do now.
After describing the dangerous tendencies in Antony’s mixed nature, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
introduces his account of the meeting at the Cydnus, with the deliberate
statement which the rest of his story merely works out in detail:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Antonius being thus inclined, the last and
extreamest mischiefe of all other (to wit, the love of Cleopatra)
lighted on him, who did waken and stirre up many vices yet hidden in
him, and were never seene to any; and if any sparke of goodnesse or
hope of rising were left him, Cleopatra quenched it straight and made
it worse than before.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Similarly his final verdict in the <i>Comparison
of Demetrius and Marcus Antonius</i> is unrelenting:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cleopatra oftentimes unarmed Antonius, and intised
him to her, making him lose matters of importaunce, and verie needeful
jorneys, to come and be dandled with her about the rivers of Canobus
and Taphosiris. In the ende as Paris fledde from battell and went to
hide him selfe in Helens armes; even so did he in Cleopatras armes, or
to speak more properlie, Paris hidde him selfe in Helens closet, but
Antonius to followe Cleopatra, fledde and lost the victorie.... He slue
him selfe (to confesse a troth) cowardly and miserably.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare by no means neglects this aspect of
the case, as Dryden tends to do, and he could never have taken Dryden’s
title for his play. Nevertheless, while agreeing with Plutarch, he
agrees with Dryden too. To him Antony’s devotion to Cleopatra is the
grand fact in his career, which bears witness to his greatness as well
as to his littleness, and is at once his perdition and his apotheosis.
And so in the third place this is a love tragedy, and has its relations
with <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, the only
other attempts that Shakespeare made in this kind: as is indicated even
in their designations. For these are the only plays that are named
after two persons, and the reason is that in a true love story both the
lovers have equal rights. The symbol for it is an ellipse with two foci
not a circle with a single centre.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
It has sometimes been pointed out that what is generally considered the
chief tragic theme and what was an almost indispensable ingredient in
the classic drama of France, is very seldom the <i>Leit-motif</i> of a
Greek or a Shakespearian masterpiece. In this triad however Shakespeare
has made use of it, and it is interesting to note the differences
of treatment in the various members of the group. In <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> he idealises youthful love with its raptures, its wonders,
its overthrow in collision with the harsh facts of life. <i>Troilus
and Cressida</i> shows the inward dissolution of such love when it is
unworthily bestowed, and suffers from want of reverence and loftiness.
In <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> love is not a revelation as in the
first, nor an illusion as in the second, but an infatuation. There is
nothing youthful about it, whether as adoration or inexperience. It is
the love that seizes the elderly man of the world, the trained mistress
of arts, and does this, as it would seem, to cajole and destroy them
both. It is in one aspect the love that Bacon describes in his essay
with that title.</p>

<p class="blockquot">He that preferred Helena, quitted the gifts of
Juno and Pallas. For whosoever esteemeth too much of Amorous Affection
quitteth both Riches and Wisedom. This Passion hath his Flouds in
the very times of Weaknesse, which are great Prosperitie and great
Adversitie, though this latter hath beene lesse observed. Both which
times kindle Love, and make it more fervent, and therefore shew it to
be the Childe of Folly. They doe best, who, if they cannot but admit
Love, yet make it keepe Quarter, And sever it wholly from their serious
Affaires and Actions of life; For if it checke once with Businesse, it
troubleth Men’s Fortunes, and maketh Men that they can no wayes be true
to their owne Ends.... In Life it doth much mischiefe, Sometimes like
a Syren, Sometimes like a Fury. You may observe that amongst all the
great and worthy Persons (whereof the memory remaineth, either Ancient
or Recent), there is not One that hath beene transported to the mad
degree of Love; which shewes that great Spirits and great Businesse doe
keepe out this weake Passion. You must except, never the lesse, Marcus
Antonius the halfe partner of the Empire of Rome.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
Part Siren, part Fury, that in truth is precisely how Plutarch would
personify the love of Antony: and yet it is just this love that makes
him memorable. Seductive and destructive in its obvious manifestations,
nevertheless for the great reason that it was so engrossing and
sincere, it reveals and unfolds a nobility and depth in his character,
of which we should otherwise never have believed him capable.</p>

<p>These three aspects of this strange play, as a chronicle history,
as a personal tragedy and as a love poem, merge and pass into each
other, but in a certain way they successively become prominent in the
following discussion.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE ASSOCIATES OF ANTONY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>The political setting of <i>Julius Caesar</i> had been the struggle
between the Old Order and the New. The Old goes out with a final and
temporary flare of success; the New asserts itself as the necessary
solution for the problem of the time, but is deprived of its guiding
genius who might best have elicited its possibilities for good and
neutralised its possibilities for evil. In <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>
we see how its mastery is established and confirmed despite the faults
and limitations of the smaller men who now represent it. But in the
process very much has been lost. The old principle of freedom, which,
even when moribund, serve to lend both the masses and the classes
activity and self-consciousness, has quite disappeared. The populace
has been dismissed from the scene, and, whenever casually mentioned, it
is only with contempt. Octavius describes it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">This common body,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To rot itself with motion.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv. 44.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Antony has passed so far from the sphere of his
oratorical triumph, that he thinks of his late supporters only as
“the shouting plebeians,” who cheapen their sight-seeing “for poor’st
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
diminutives, for doits” (<span class="smcap">iv.</span> xiii. 33).
His foreign Queen has been taught his scorn of the Imperial people,
and pictures them as “mechanic slaves, with greasy aprons, rules, and
hammers,” and with “their thick breaths, rank of gross diet”
(<span class="allsmcap">v.</span> ii. 208). Beyond these insults there is
no reference to the plebs, except that, as we learn from Octavius, he and
Antony have both notified it of their respective grievances against
each other; but this is a mere formality that has not the slightest
effect on the progress of events, and no citizen or group of citizens
has part in the play.</p>

<p>Even the idea of the State is in abeyance. The sense of the majesty
of Rome, which inspired both the conspirators and their opponents,
seems extinct. No enterprise, whether right or wrong, is undertaken
in the name of patriotism. On the very outposts of the Empire, where,
in conflict with the national foe, the love of country is apt to burn
more clearly than amidst the security and altercation of the capital,
we see a general, in the moment of victory, swayed in part by affection
for his patron, in part by care for his own interest, but not in the
slightest degree by civic or even chivalrous considerations. When
Ventidius is urged by Silius to pursue his advantage against the
Parthians, he replies that he has done enough:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Who does i’ the wars more than his captain can</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Becomes his captain’s captain: and ambition,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The soldier’s virtue, rather makes choice of loss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than gain which darkens him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could do more to do Antonius good,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Should my performance perish.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 21.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And not only is Silius convinced; he gives his
full approval to Ventidius’ policy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Thou hast, Ventidius, that</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 27.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span></p>
<p>Are things better with Octavius’ understrappers? They serve him well
and astutely, but there is no hint that their service is prompted
by any large public aim, and its very efficacy is due in great
measure to its unscrupulousness. Agrippa and Mecaenas are ready for
politic reasons to suggest or support the marriage of the chaste and
gentle Octavia with a voluptuary like Mark Antony, whose record they
know perfectly well, and pay decorous attentions to Lepidus while
mocking him behind his back: Thyreus and Proculeius make love to the
employment, when Octavius commissions them to cajole and deceive
Cleopatra; Dolabella produces the pleasantest impression, just because,
owing to a little natural manly feeling, he palters with his prescribed
obligations to his master. But in none of them all is there a trace of
any liberal or generous conception of duty; they are human instruments,
more or less efficient, more or less trustworthy, who make their career
by serving the purposes of Octavius’ personal ambition.</p>

<p>Or turn to the court of Alexandria with its effeminacy,
wine-bibbing, and gluttony. Sextus Pompeius talks of its “field
of feasts,” its “epicurean cooks,” its “cloyless sauce”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i. 22, <i>et seq.</i>). Antony palliates
his neglect of the message from Rome with the excuse that, having newly
feasted three kings, he did “want of what he was i’ the morning”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> ii. 76). But even in the morning, as
Cleopatra recalls, he can be drunk to bed ere the ninth hour, and then
let himself be clad in female garb (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> v. 21).</p>

<p>It is not indeed to Egypt that this intemperance is confined. The
contagion has spread to the West, as we see from the picture of the
orgy on board the galley at Misenum; a picture we may take in a special
way to convey Shakespeare’s idea of the conditions, since he had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
authority for it, but freely worked it up from Plutarch’s innocent
statement that Pompey gave the first of the series of banquets on board
his admiral galley, “and there he welcomed them and made them great
cheere.” But in the play all the boon companions, and not merely the
home-comers from the East, cup each other till the world goes round;
save only the sober Octavius, and even he admits that his tongue
“splits what it speaks.” “This is not yet an Alexandrian feast,” says
Pompey. “It ripens towards it,” answers Antony (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> vii. 102).
It ripens towards it indeed; but more in the way of crude excess
than of curious corruption. In that the palace of the Ptolemies with
its eunuchs and fortune-tellers, its male and female time-servers and
hangers-on, is still inimitable and unchallenged. It is interesting
to note how Shakespeare fills in the previous history of Iras and
Charmian, whom Plutarch barely mentions till he tells of their heroic
death. In the drama they are introduced at first as the products of a
life from which all modesty is banished by reckless luxury and smart
frivolity. Their conversation in the second scene serves to show the
unabashed <i>protervitas</i> that has infected souls capable of high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
loyalty and devotion.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
And their intimate is the absolutely contemptible Lord Alexas, with his
lubricity, officiousness and flatteries, who, when evil days come, will
persuade Herod of Jewry to forsake the cause of his patrons and will
earn his due reward (<span class="smcap">iv.</span> vi. 12). For there
is no moral cement to hold together this ruinous world. After Actium
the deserters are so numerous that Octavius can say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">Within our files there are,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of those that served Mark Antony but late,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enough to fetch him in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 12.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There is not even decent delay in their apostasy.
The battle is hardly over when six tributary kings show “the way
of yielding” to Canidius, who at once renders his legions and his
horse to Caesar (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> x. 33). Shakespeare
heightens Plutarch’s statement in regard to this, for in point of fact
Canidius waited seven days on the chance that Antony might rejoin
them, and then, according to Plutarch, merely fled without changing
sides: but the object is to set forth the universal demoralisation and
instability, and petty qualifications like that implied in the week’s
delay or abandonment of the post instead of desertion to the enemy
are dismissed as of no account. In another addition, for which he has
likewise no warrant, Shakespeare clothes the prevalent temper in words.
When Pompey rejects the unscrupulous device to obtain the empire, Menas
is made to exclaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">For this,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll never follow thy pall’d fortunes more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vii. 87.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Menas is a pirate, but he speaks the thought of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
the time; for it is only to fortune that the whole generation is
faithful. Everywhere the cult of material good prevails, whether in
the way of acquisition or enjoyment; and that can give no sanction to
payment of service apart from the results.</p>

<p>The corroding influence of the <i>Zeitgeist</i> even on natures
naturally honest and sound is vividly illustrated in the story of
Enobarbus: and the study of his character is peculiarly interesting
and instructive, because he is the only one of the more prominent
personages who is practically a new creation in the drama, the only
one in whose delineation Shakespeare has gone quite beyond the limits
supplied by Plutarch, even while making use of them. Lepidus and
Pompey, with whom he proceeds in a somewhat similar fashion, are mere
subordinates. Octavius and even Cleopatra are only interpreted with
new vividness and insight. Antony himself is exhibited only with the
threads of his nature transposed, as, for example, when a fabric is
held up with its right side instead of its seamy side outwards. But for
Enobarbus, who often occupies the front of the stage, the dramatist
found only a few detached sentences that suggested a few isolated
traits, and while preserving these intact, he introduces them merely as
component elements in an entirely original and complex personality. It
is therefore fair to suppose that the character of Enobarbus will be of
peculiar importance in the economy of the piece.</p>

<p>Plutarch refers to him thrice. The first mention is not very
noticeable. Antony, during his campaign in Parthia, had on one occasion
to announce to his army a rather disgraceful composition with the
enemy, according to which he received permission to retreat in peace.</p>

<p class="blockquot">But though he had an excellent tongue at will, and
very gallant to enterteine his souldiers and men of warre, and that he
could passingly well do it, as well, or better then any Captaine in his
time, yet being ashamed for respects, he would not speake unto them at
his removing, but willed Domitius Ænobarbus to do it.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
Thus we see Enobarbus designated for a somewhat invidious and trying
task, and this implies Antony’s confidence in him, and his own efficiency.</p>

<p>Then we are told that when the rupture with Caesar came,</p>

<p class="blockquot">Antonius, through the perswasions of Domitius,
commaunded Cleopatra to returne againe into Ægypt, and there to
understand<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
the successe of this warre,</p>

<p class="no-indent">a command, which, however, she managed to
overrule. Here again in Enobarbus’ counsel we see the hard-headed
and honest officer, who wishes things to be done in the right way,
and risks ill-will to have them so done. It is on this passage that
Shakespeare bases the outburst of Cleopatra and the downright and
sensible remonstrance of Enobarbus.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cle.</i> I will be even with thee, doubt it not.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> But why, why, why?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cle.</i> Thou hast forespoke my being in these wars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And say’st it is not fit.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> Well, is it, is it?</div>
    <div class="verse indent33">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vii. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">More remotely too this gave Shakespeare the hint
for Enobarbus’ other censures on Antony’s conduct of the campaign.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in the account of the various misfortunes that befell Antony
before Actium, and the varying moods in which he confronted them,
Shakespeare read:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Furthermore, he dealt very friendely and
courteously with Domitius, and against Cleopatraes mynde. For, he
being sicke of an agewe when he went and tooke a little boate to goe
to Caesars campe, Antonius was very sory for it, but yet he sent after
him all his caryage, trayne and men: and the same Domitius, as though
he gave him to understand that he repented his open treason, he died
immediately after.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
This, of course, supplied Shakespeare with the episodes of Enobarbus’
desertion and death, though he altered the date of the first, delaying
it till the last flicker of Antony’s fortune; and the manner of the
second, making it the consequence, which the penitent deliberately
desires, of a broken heart.</p>

<p>But this is all that Plutarch has to say about the soldier. He is
capable; he is honest and bold in recommending the right course; when
Antony wilfully follows the wrong one, he forsakes him; but, touched
perhaps by his magnanimity, dies, it may be, in remorse.</p>

<p>Now see how Shakespeare fills in and adds to this general outline.
Practical intelligence, outspoken honesty, real capacity for feeling,
are still the fundamental traits, and we have evidence of them all from
the outset. But, in the first place, they have received a peculiar
turn from the habits of the camp. Antony, rebuking and excusing his
bluntness, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art a soldier only, speak no more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 109.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Indeed he is a soldier, if not only, at any
rate chiefly and essentially; and a soldier of the adventurer type,
carrying with him an initial suggestion of the more modern gentlemen
of fortune like Le Balafré or Dugald Dalgetty, who would fight for
any cause, and offered their services for the highest reward to the
leader most likely to secure it for them. He has also their ideas of
a soldier’s pleasures, and has no fancy for playing the ascetic. In
Alexandria he has had a good time, in his own sphere and in his own way
indulging in the feasts and carouses and gallantries of his master. He
tells Mecaenas, thoroughly associating himself with the exploits of Antony:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We did sleep day out of countenance, and made the night
light with drinking.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 181.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
He speaks with authority of the immortal breakfast at which the eight
wild boars were served, but makes little of it as by no means out of
the way. Similarly he identifies himself with Antony in their love
affairs when Antony announces his intention of setting out at once:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Why, then, we kill all our women: we see how mortal an unkindness is
to them: if they suffer our departure, death’s the word.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 137.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And after the banquet on the galley, when the
exalted personages, “these great fellows,” as Menas calls them, have
retired more than a little disguised in liquor, he, fresh from the
Egyptian Bacchanals, stays behind to finish up the night in Menas’
cabin.</p>

<p>Yet he has a certain contempt for the very vices in which he himself
shares, at least if their practitioners are overcome by them and cannot
retain their self-command even in their indulgence. When Lepidus
succumbs, this more seasoned vessel jeers at him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent5">There’s a strong fellow, Menas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">[<i>pointing to the attendant who carries off Lepidus.</i>]</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Men.</i> Why?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Eno.</i> A’ bears the third part of the world, man: see’st not?</div>
    <div class="verse indent40">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vii. 95.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Nor does he suffer love to interfere with business:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Under a compelling occasion, let women die: it were pity to cast
them away for nothing: though, between them and a great cause, they
should be esteemed nothing.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 141.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">His practical shrewdness enables him, though of
a very different nature from Cassius, to look, like Cassius, quite
through the deeds of men. He always lays his finger on the inmost
nerve of a situation or complication. Thus when Mecaenas urges the
need of amity on the Triumvirs, Enobarbus’ disconcerting frankness
goes straight to the point that the smooth propriety of the other evades:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may,
when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again: you

<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 103.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Antony silences him, saying he wrongs this
presence; but Octavius sees he has hit the nail on the head though in a
somewhat indecorous way:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I do not much dislike the matter, but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The manner of his speech.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 113.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Just in the same way he takes the measure of
the arts and wiles and affectations of Cleopatra and her ladies, and
admits no cant into the consolations which he offers Antony on Fulvia’s
death:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.... Your old
smock brings forth a new petticoat; and indeed the tears
live in an onion that should water this sorrow.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 167.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Yet he is by no means indifferent to real charm,
to the spell of refinement, grace and beauty. Like many who profess
cynicism, and even in a way are really cynical, he is all the more
susceptible to what in any kind will stand his exacting tests,
especially if it contrast with his own rough jostling life of the
barracks and of the field. It is in his mouth that Shakespeare places
that incomparable description of Cleopatra on the Cydnus, and there
could be no more fitting celebrant of her witchery. Of course the
poetry of the passage is supposed in part to be due to the theme, and
is a tribute to Cleopatra’s fascinations; but Enobarbus has the soul
to feel them and the imagination to portray them. Indeed she has no
such enraptured eulogist as he. He may object to her presence in the
camp and to her interference in the counsels of war; but that is only
because, like Bacon, he believes that “they do best, who if they cannot
but admit love, make it keep quarter, and sever it wholly from their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
serious affairs and actions of life”; it is not because he underrates her
enchantment or would advise Antony to forego it. On the contrary, he
seems to reproach his general when, in a passing movement of remorse,
Antony regrets having ever seen her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>O, sir, you then had left unseen a wonderful piece of work; which
not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 159.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And he not only sees that Antony, despite the most
sacred of ties, the most urgent of interests, will inevitably return to
her: the enthusiasm of his words shows that their predestinate union
has his full sympathy and approval.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Mec.</i> Now Antony must leave her utterly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> Never; he will not;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And this responsiveness to what is gracious, has
its complement in his responsiveness to what is magnificent. He has an
ardent admiration for his “Emperor.” He is exceeding jealous for his
honour, and has no idea of the mighty Antony stooping his crest to any
power on earth. When Lepidus begs him to entreat his captain “to soft
and gentle speech” towards Octavius, he retorts with hot pride and
zeal, like a clansman’s for his chief:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="no-indent">He glories even in Antony’s more doubtful
qualities, his lavishness, his luxury, his conviviality, his success
in love, for in all these his master shows a sort of royal exuberance;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
and they serve in the eyes of this practical but splendour-loving
veteran to set off his more technical excellences, the “absolute
soldiership,” the “renowned knowledge” on which he also dwells (<span
class="smcap">iii.</span> vii. 43 and 46). But with all his enthusiasm
for Antony, he is from the first critical of what he considers his
weaknesses and mistakes, just as with all his enthusiasm for Cleopatra
he has a keen eye for her affectations and interferences. Knowing
Antony’s real bent, he sees the inexpedience of the Roman marriage, and
foretells the result:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Men.</i> Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prophesy so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Men.</i> I think the policy of that purpose made more in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">marriage than the love of the parties.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> I think so too. But you shall find, the band that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of their amity.</div>
    <div class="verse indent38">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vi. 122.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He is as contemptuous of Antony’s easy
emotionalism as of Octavius’ politic family affection. At the parting
of brother and sister, Enobarbus and Agrippa exchange the asides:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> Will Caesar weep?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Agr.</i> He has a cloud in’s face.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> He were the worse for that, were he a horse;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So is he, being a man.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Agr.</i><span class="ws6">Why, Enobarbus,</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He cried almost to roaring: and he wept</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i> That year, indeed, he was troubled with a rheum;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What willingly he did confound he wail’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Believe’t, till I wept too.</div>
    <div class="verse indent35">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 51.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is therefore not hard to understand how, when
Antony wilfully sacrifices his advantages and rushes on his ruin, his
henchman’s feelings should be outraged and his fidelity should receive
a shock. After the flight at Actium, Cleopatra asks him: “Is Antony
or we in fault for this?” And Enobarbus, though he had opposed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
presence and plans of the Queen, is inexorable in laying the blame on
the right shoulders:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Antony only, that would make his will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lord of his reason.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 3.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He is raised above the common run of the
legionaries by his devotion to his master; but his devotion is half
instinctive, half critical; and, as a rational man, he can suppress in
his nature the faithful dog. For the tragedy of Enobarbus’ position
lies in this: that in that evil time his reason can furnish him with
no motive for his loyalty except self-interest and confidence in his
leader’s capacity; or, failing these, the unsubstantial recompense
of fame. He is not Antony’s man from principle, in order to uphold a
great cause,—no one in the play has chosen his side on such a ground;
and fidelity at all costs to a person is a forgotten phrase among the
cosmopolitan materialists who are competing for the spoils of the
Roman world. So what is he to do? His instincts pull him one way, his
reason another, and in such an one instincts unjustified by reason lose
half their strength. At first he fights valiantly on behalf of his
inarticulate natural feeling. When Canidius deserts, he still refuses
in the face of evidence to accept the example:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent23">I’ll yet follow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sits in the wind against me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> x. 35.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But Antony’s behaviour in defeat, his alternations
between the supine and the outrageous, shake him still more; and only
the allurement of future applause, not a very cogent one to such a man
in such an age, wards off for a while the negative decision:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mine honesty and I begin to square.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The loyalty well held to fools does make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To follow with allegiance a fall’n lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Does conquer him that did his master conquer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And earns a place i’ the story.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 41.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
The paltering of Cleopatra however is a further object lesson:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy dearest quit thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 63.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then the observation of Antony’s frenzy of wrath
and frenzy of courage finally convinces him that the man is doomed, and
he forms his resolution:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now he’ll outstare the lightning.&emsp;To be furious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is to be frighted out of fear: and in that mood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A diminution in our captain’s brain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some way to leave him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 195.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There is something inevitable in his recreancy,
for the principle that Menas puts in words is the presupposition on
which everybody acts; and Antony himself can understand exactly what
has taken place:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">O, my fortunes have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Corrupted honest men!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v. 16.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Enobarbus’ heart is right, but in the long run
it has no chance against the convincing arguments of the situation.
And yet his heart has shown him the worthy way, and, in his despair
and remorse, it recovers hold of the truth that his head had made
him doubt. Observe however that even his revulsion of feeling is
brought about by the appeal to his worldly wisdom; it is not by their
unassisted power that the discredited whispers of conscience make
themselves heard and regain their authority. Enobarbus’ penitence,
though sudden, is all rationally explained, and is quite different
from the miraculous conversions of some wrong-doers in fiction, who in
an instant are awakened to grace for no conceivable cause and by no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
intelligible means. He is made to realise that he has taken wrong
measures in his own interest, by Octavius’ treatment of the other
deserters.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Affairs of Antony; there did persuade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 11.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then the transmission to him of his treasure with increase, makes
him feel that after all loyalty might have been a more profitable
investment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">O Antony,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou mine of bounty, how would’st thou have paid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My better service, when my turpitude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou dost so crown with gold!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 31.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">But he does not stop here. It is only in this way
that his judgment, trained by the time to test all things by material
advantage, can be convinced. But when it is convinced, his deeper and
nobler nature finds free vent in self-recrimination and self-reproach.
He goes on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">This blows my heart:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do’t, I feel.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I fight against thee! No: I will go seek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some ditch wherein to die; the foul’st best fits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My latter part of life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 35.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And this too is most natural. Antony’s generosity
restores to him his old impression of Antony’s magnificence which
he had lost in these last sorry days. With that returns his old
enthusiasm, and with that awakes the sense of his own transgression
against such greatness. He is ready now in expiation to sacrifice the
one thing that in the end made him still shrink from treason. He had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
tried to steady himself, as we have seen, with the thought that the
glory of loyalty would be his, if he remained faithful to the last. Now
he demands the brand of treachery for his name, though he fain would
have Antony’s pardon for himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent23">O Antony,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nobler than my revolt is infamous,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgive me in thine own particular:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But let the world rank me in register</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A master-leaver and a fugitive.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ix. 18.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thus he dies heart-broken and in despair. Personal
attachment to an individual, the one ethical motive that lingers in a
world of self-seekers to give existence some dignity and worth, is the
inspiration of his soul. But even this he cannot preserve unspoiled: on
accepted assumptions he is forced to deny and desecrate it. He succumbs
less through his own fault than through the fault of the age; and this
is his grand failure. When he realises what it means, there is no need
of suicide: he is killed by “swift thought,” by the consciousness that
his life with this on his record is loathsome and alien, a “very rebel
to his will,” that only “hangs on him” (<span class="smcap">iv.</span> ix. 14).</p>

<p>Among the struggling and contentious throng of worldlings and egoists
who to succeed must tread their nobler instincts underfoot, and even so
do not always succeed, are there any honest and sterling characters at
all? There are a few, in the background, barely sketched, half hid from
sight. But we can perceive their presence, and even distinguish their
gait and bearing, though the artist’s purpose forbade their portrayal
in detail.</p>

<p>First of these is Scarus, the simple and valiant fightingman,
who resents the infatuation of Antony and the ruinous influence
of Cleopatra as deeply as Enobarbus, but whose unsophisticated
soldier-nature keeps him to his colours with a troth that the less naïf
Enobarbus could admire but could not observe. It is from his mouth that
the most opprobrious epithets are hurled on the absconding pair, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
“ribaudred nag of Egypt, whom leprosy o’ertake,” and “the doting
mallard,” “the noble ruin of her magic” who has kissed away kingdoms
and provinces. But as soon as he hears they have fled toward
Peloponnesus, he cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis easy to’t; and there will I attend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What further comes.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> x. 32.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He attends to good purpose, and is the hero of the
last skirmish; when Antony’s prowess rouses him to applause, from which
he is too honest to exclude reproach:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had we done so at first, we had droven them home</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With clouts about their heads.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vii. 4.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then halting-bleeding, with a wound that from a T
has been made an H, he still follows the chase. It is a little touch of
irony, apt to be overlooked, that he, who has cursed Cleopatra’s magic
and raged because kingdoms were kissed away, should now as grand reward
have his merits commended to “this great fairy,” and as highest honour
have leave to raise her hand—the hand that cost Thyreus so dear—to
his own lips. Doubtless, despite his late outbreak, he appreciates
these favours as much as the golden armour that Cleopatra adds. Says
Antony,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He has deserved it, were it carbuncled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like holy Phoebus car.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> viii. 28.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He has: for he is of other temper than his
nameless and featureless original in Plutarch, who is merely a
subaltern who had fought well in the sally.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cleopatra to reward his manlines, gave him an
armor and head peece of cleene gold: howbeit the man at armes when he
had received this rich gift, stale away by night and went to Caesar.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Not so Scarus. He is still at his master’s side on
the disastrous morrow and takes from him the last orders that Antony as
commander ever gave.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>

<p>In this Roman legionary the spirit of military obligation still asserts
its power; and the spirit of domestic obligation is as strong in the
Roman matron Octavia. Shakespeare has been accused of travestying
this noble and dutiful lady. He certainly does not do that, and the
strange misstatement has arisen from treating seriously Cleopatra’s
distortion of the messenger’s report, or from taking that report, when
the messenger follows Cleopatra’s lead, as Shakespeare’s deliberate
verdict. If the messenger says that she is low-voiced and not so
tall as her rival, is that equivalent to the “dull of tongue, and
dwarfish” into which it is translated? And finding it so translated,
is it wonderful that the browbeaten informant should henceforth adopt
the same style himself, and exaggerate her deliberate motion to
creeping, her statuesque dignity to torpor, the roundness of her face
to deformity—which Cleopatra at once interprets as foolishness—the
lowness of her forehead to as much as you please, or, in his phrase,
“as she would wish it.” Agrippa, on the other hand speaks of her as one,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent13">whose beauty claims</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No worse a husband than the best of men:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose virtue and whose general graces speak</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That which none else can utter.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 130.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Mecaenas, too, pays his tribute to her “beauty, wisdom, modesty”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> ii. 246). And if the praises of the courtiers are
suspect, they are not more so than the censures with which Cleopatra
flatters herself or is flattered. But if we dismiss, or at least
discount, both sets of overstatements, and with them Antony’s own
phrase, “a gem of women,” uttered in the heat of jealous contrast,
there are other conclusive evidences of the opinion in which she is
held. Enobarbus speaks of her “holy, cold, and still conversation”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> vi. 131). Antony thinks of her as patient, even when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
threatens Cleopatra with her vengeance by personal assault
(<span class="smcap">iv.</span> xii. 38). Cleopatra, with her finer intuition, even when
recalling Antony’s threat, conjectures more justly what that vengeance
would be:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Demuring upon me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xv. 27.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And elsewhere she asserts that she will not</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">once be chastised with the sober eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of dull Octavia.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 54.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is easy to construct her picture from these
hints. Calm, pure, devout, submissive; quite without vivacity or
initiative, she presents the old-fashioned ideal of womanhood, that
finds a sphere subordinate though august, by the domestic hearth. And
this is in the main Plutarch’s conception of her too. But there are
differences. The sacrifices of the lady to the exigencies of statecraft
is emphasised by the historian: “She was maryed unto him as it were
of necessitie, bicause her brother Caesars affayres so required it,”
and that even in her year of mourning, so that a dispensation had to
be obtained; since it was “against the law that a widow should be
maried within tenne monethes after her husbandes death.” Nevertheless
her association with Antony is far more intimate in Plutarch than in
Shakespeare; she is the mother of his children, feels bound to him,
and definitely takes his side. When relations first become strained
between the brothers-in-law, and not, as in the drama, just before
the final breach, she plays the peace maker, but successfully and on
Antony’s behalf. She seeks out her brother; tells him she is now the
happiest woman in the world; if war should break out between them, “it
is uncertaine to which of them the goddes have assigned the victorie or
overthrowe. But for me, on which side soever victorie fall, my state
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
can be but most miserable still.” In Shakespeare this petition, eked
out with reminiscences of the appeal of Blanch in <i>King John</i>, and
with anticipations of the appeal of Volumnia in <i>Coriolanus</i>, is
addressed to Antony, and the even balance of her sympathies is accented
and reiterated in a way for which Plutarch gives no warrant.</p>

<p>In the <i>Life</i> again, even when Antony has rejoined Cleopatra, has
showered provinces on her and his illegitimate children, and, after the
Parthian campaign, is living with her once more, Octavia insists on
seeking him out and brings him</p>

<p class="blockquot no-indent">great store of apparell for souldiers,
a great number of horse, summe of money, and gifts, to bestow on his
friendes and Captaines he had about him: and besides all those, she
had two thowsand souldiers chosen men, all well armed, like unto the
Praetors bands.</p>

<p class="no-indent">She has to return from Athens without seeing
Antony, but, despite Caesar’s command, she still lives in her husband’s
house, still tries to heal the division, looks after his children and
promotes the business of all whom he sends to Rome.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Howbeit thereby, thinking no hurt, she did
Antonius great hurt. For her honest love and regard to her husband,
made every man hate him, when they sawe he did so unkindly use so noble
a Lady.</p>

<p class="no-indent">And finally, when Antony sent her word to leave
his house, she took with her all his children save Fulvia’s eldest
son who was with his father, and instead of showing resentment, only
bewailed and lamented “her cursed hap that had brought her to this,
that she was accompted one of the chiefest causes of this civill
warre.”</p>

<p>Her even more magnanimous care for all Antony’s offspring without
distinction, when Antony is no more, belongs of course to a later date;
but all the previous instances of her devotion to his interest fall well
within the limits of the play, and yet Shakespeare makes no use of them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span></p>

<p>It does not suit him to suggest that Antony ever deviated from his
passion for Cleopatra or bestowed his affection elsewhere: indeed, on
the eve of his marriage, he reveals his heart and intentions clearly
enough. But Shakespeare also knows that without affection to bring it
out, there will be no answering affection in a woman like Octavia. She
will be true to all her obligations, so long as they are obligations,
but no love will be roused to make her do more than is in her bond.
And of love there is in the play as little trace on her part as on
Antony’s. It is brother and sister, not husband and wife, that exchange
the most endearing terms: “Sweet Octavia,” “My dearest sister,” and “my
noble brother,” “most dear Caesar”; while to Antony she is “Octavia,”
“gentle Octavia,” or at most “Dear Lady,” and to her he is “Good my
lord.” At the parting in Rome Caesar has a cloud in his face and her
eyes drop tears like April showers. At the parting in Athens there is
only the formal permission to leave, on the one hand, and the formal
acknowledgment on the other. Evidently, if, as she says, she has her</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">heart parted betwixt two friends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That do afflict each other,</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vi. 77.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">or if Antony describes her equipoise of feeling as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent13">the swan’s down-feather,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That stands upon the swell at full of tide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And neither way inclines,</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 48.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">it is not because she regards them both with
equal tenderness. Her brother has her love; her husband, so long as he
deserves it, has her duty. But when he forfeits his claim, she has done
with him, unlike Plutarch’s Octavia, who pursues him to the end, and
beyond the end, with a self-forgetfulness that her mere covenant could
never call forth. Of all this there is nothing in the play. Her appeal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
to Antony in defence of Caesar is far warmer than her appeal to Caesar
on behalf of Antony, and when she definitely hears that Antony has not
only joined Cleopatra against her brother but has installed Cleopatra
in her own place, she merely says, “Is it so?” and falls silent. No
wonder. She is following Antony’s instructions to the letter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Best to preserve it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 21.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When it appears to you where this begins,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn your displeasure that way; for our faults</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can never be so equal that your love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can equally move with them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 33.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">But this tacit assumption, fully borne out by
her previous words, that the claims of husband and brother are equal
in her eyes, and that the precedence is to be determined merely
by a comparison of faults, shows how little of wifely affection
Octavia felt, though doubtless she would be willing to fulfil her
responsibilities to the smallest jot and tittle.</p>

<p>The hurried, loveless and transitory union, into which Antony has
entered only to suit his convenience, for as Enobarbus says, “he
married but his occasion here,” and into which Octavia has entered
only out of deference to her brother who “uses his power unto her,”
has thus merely a political and moral but no emotional significance.
This Roman marriage lies further apart from the love story of Antony
than the marriage in Brittany does from the love story of Tristram.
This diplomatic alliance interferes as little with Octavia’s sisterly
devotion to Octavius as the political alliances of Marguerite
d’Angoulême interfered with her sisterly devotion to Francis I. And
much is gained by this for the play. In the first place the hero no
longer, as in the biography, offends us by fickleness in his grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
idolatry and infidelity to a second attachment, on the one hand, or
by ingratitude to a longsuffering and loving wife on the other. But
just for that reason Octavia does not really enter into his life,
and claims no full delineation. She is hardly visible, and does not
disturb our sympathies with the lovers or force on us moral regards by
demuring on them and chastising them with her sober eyes. Nevertheless
visible at intervals she is, and then she seems to tell of another life
than that of Alexandrian indulgence, a narrower life of obligations
and pieties beside which the carnival of impulse is both glorified
and condemned. And she does this not less effectually, but a great
deal less obtrusively, that in her shadowy form as she flits from the
mourning-chamber to the altar at the bidding of her brother, and from
Athens to Rome to preserve the peace, we see rather the self-devoted
sister than the devoted wife. For in the play she is sister first and
essentially, and wife only in the second place because her sisterly
feeling is so strong.</p>

<p>Still more slightly sketched than the domestic loyalty of Octavia or
even than the military loyalty of Scarus, is the loyalty of Eros the
servant; but it is the most affecting of all, for it is to the death.
Characteristically, he who obtains the highest spiritual honours that
are awarded to any person in the play, is one of a class to which in
the prime of ancient civilisation the possibility of any moral life
would in theory have been denied. Morality was for the free citizen
of a free state: the slave was not really capable of it. And indeed
it is clear that often for the slave, who might be only one of the
goods and chattels of his owner, the sole chance of escape from a
condition of spiritual as well as physical servitude would lie in
personal enthusiasm for the master, in willing self-absorption in him.
But in a world like that of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> such personal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
enthusiasm, as we have seen, is almost the highest thing that remains.
So it is the quondam slave, Eros the freedman, bred in the cult of it,
who bears away the palm. Antony commands him to slay him:</p>

</div>

<p>So much for the freedman whom Antony hails as his master, thrice nobler
than himself. But what about his betters, the “great fellows” as Menas
calls them, his rivals and associates in Empire?</p>

<p>Let us run through the series of them; and despite his pride of place
we cannot begin lower than with the third Triumvir.</p>

<p>Lepidus, the “slight unmeritable man, meet to be sent on errands,” as
he is described in <i>Julius Caesar</i>, maintains the same character
here, and is hardly to be talked of “but as a property.” In the first
scene where he appears, when he and Octavius are discussing Antony’s
absence, he is a mere cypher. Even in this hour of need, Octavius
unconsciously and as a matter of course treats Antony’s negligence
as a wrong not to them both but only to himself. The messenger never
addresses Lepidus and assumes that the question is between Caesar and
Pompey alone. At the close this titular partner “beseeches” to be
informed of what takes place, and Octavius acknowledges that it is his
“bond,” but clearly it is not his choice.</p>

<p>No doubt on the surface he pleases by his moderate and conciliatory
attitude. When Octavius is indicting his absent colleague, Lepidus is
frank in his excuse:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">I must not think there are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Evils enow to darken all his goodness:</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv. 10.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Knowing the zeal and influence of Enobarbus, he
recommends his mediation as a becoming and worthy deed, and tries to
mitigate his vehemence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Your speech is passion:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, pray you, stir no embers up.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 12.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And when the Triumvirs meet, the counsels of
forbearance, which Shakespeare assigns to him and which in Plutarch are
not associated with his name, are just in the right tone:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Noble friends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That which combined us was most great, and let not</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">May it be gently heard: when we debate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our trivial difference loud, we do commit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 17.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But all this springs from no real kindliness or
public spirit. Pompey understands the position:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Lepidus flatters both,</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is mere indolence and flaccidity of temper that
makes him ready to play the peace-maker, and his efforts are proof of
incompetence rather than of nobility. He is so anxious to agree with
everybody and ingratiate himself with both parties, that he excites the
ridicule not only of the downright Enobarbus, but of the reticent and
diplomatic Agrippa:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Eno.</i>                      O, how he loves Caesar!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Agr.</i> Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Eno.</i> Caesar? Why, he’s the Jupiter of men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Agr.</i> What’s Antony? The god of Jupiter.

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He will be all things to all men that he himself
may be saved; and his love of peace runs parallel with his readiness
for good cheer. He likes to enjoy himself and soon drinks himself
drunk. The very servants see through his infirmity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Sec. Serv.</i> As they pinch one another by the

</div>

<p class="no-indent">And they proceed to draw the moral of the whole
situation. Lepidus’ ineptitude is due to the same circumstance that
brings Costard’s criticism on Sir Nathaniel when the curate breaks
down in the pageant. “A foolish mild man; an honest man, look you,
and soon dashed. He is a marvellous good neighbour, faith, ... but,
for Alexander,—alas, you see how ’tis,—a little o’erparted.” Lepidus
too is a marvellous good neighbour, but for a Triumvir,—alas, you see
how ’tis,—a little o’erparted. He is attempting a part or role that
is too big for him. He is in a position and company where his nominal
influence goes for nothing and his want of perception puts him to the blush.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Sec. Serv.</i> Why, this it is to have a name in great men’s

</div>

<p class="no-indent">In his efforts at <i>bonhomie</i>, he becomes so
bemused that even Antony, generally so affable and courteous, does not
trouble to be decently civil, and flouts him to his wine-sodden face,
with impertinent school-boy jests about the crocodile that is shaped
like itself, and is as broad as it has breadth, and weeps tears that
are wet. Caesar, ever on the guard, asks in cautious admonition: “Will
this description satisfy him?” But Antony is scornfully aware that he
may dismiss punctilios:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent40">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vii. 56.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">His deposition, which must come in the natural
course of things, is mentioned only casually and contemptuously:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Caesar, having made use of him in the wars ’gainst Pompey, presently
denied him rivality: would not let him partake in the glory of the
action: and not resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
wrote to Pompey: upon his own appeal, seizes him: so the poor third is
up, till death enlarge his confine.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 7.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Accused of letters written to Pompey! So he
had been at his old work, buttering his bread on both sides. His
suppression is one of the grievances Antony has against Caesar, who has
appropriated his colleague’s revenue; and it is interesting to note the
defence that Caesar, who never chooses his grounds at random, gives for
his apparent arbitrariness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he his high authority abused,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And did deserve his change.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vi. 32.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
So this friend of all the world may be accused of inhumanity and
misrule. The charge is plausible. Shakespeare could not here forget
that at the proscription, Lepidus is represented as acquiescing in the
death of his own brother-in-law to secure the death of Antony’s nephew.
Still his alleged cruelty may only have been a specious pretext on
Octavius’ part to screen his own designs, and even to transfer his own
offences to another man’s shoulders. Pompey says, in estimating the
chances of his venture,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Caesar gets money where</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He loses hearts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 13.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Appian refers to these exactions, but in Plutarch
there is as yet no mention of Octavius making himself unpopular by
exorbitant imposts, and only at a later time is he said to have done
so in preparing for his war with Antony. The subsequent passage, which
Shakespeare does not use, or hardly uses, in its proper place, may have
suggested the present statement:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The great and grievous exactions of money did
sorely oppresse the people.... Hereuppon there arose a wonderfull
exclamation and great uprore all Italy over: so that among the greatest
faults that ever Antonius committed., they blamed him most for that he
delayed to give Caesar battell.... When such a great summe of money was
demaunded of them, they grudged at it, and grewe to mutinie upon it.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Does Shakespeare, by antedating Caesar’s
oppressive measures, mean to insinuate his own gloss on the charge of
cruelty against Lepidus that he found in Plutarch? At any rate in that
case Octavius would be merely following the course that Antony had
already laid down:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Though we lay these honours on this man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To groan and sweat under the business,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Either led or driven, as we point the way:
            <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And having brought our treasure where we will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then take we down his load, and turn him off,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And graze in commons.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<i>J. C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> i. 19.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Octavius certainly carries out Antony’s programme
in the result, and it would add to the irony of the situation if he had
also done so in the process, and, while exploiting Lepidus’ resources,
had incidentally eased himself of a slanderous load. No wonder that
Antony is annoyed. But if he frets at his colleague’s undoing, we may
be sure that apart from personal chagrin, it is only because Octavius’
influence has been increased and his own share of the spoils withheld.
Of personal regret there is nothing in his reported reception of the
news. Lepidus the man, Antony dismisses with an angry gesture and
exclamation: he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent28">spurns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rush that lies before him; cries, “Fool, Lepidus!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 17.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Sextus Pompeius who at one time had a fair chance of entering into a
position equal or superior to that of Lepidus, comes higher in the
scale than he. He has a certain feeling for righteousness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If the great gods be just, they shall assist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The deeds of justest men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He has a certain nobility of sentiment that
enables him to rise to the occasion. When to his surprise he learns
that he will have to reckon with the one man he dreads, he cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">But let us rear</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 35.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So, when told that he looks older, his reply is
magnanimous:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
Antony confesses that he owes him thanks for generous treatment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He hath laid strange courtesies and great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of late upon me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 157.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">We presently get to hear what these were, and must
admit that he acted like a gentleman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Though I lose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The praise of it by telling, you must know,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Her welcome friendly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vi. 43.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He has moreover a certain filial piety for the
memory of his father, and a certain afterglow of free republican
sentiment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">What was’t</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Cast on my noble father.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vi. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But even if all this were quite genuine, it
would not suffice to form a really distinguished character. In the
first place Sextus never penetrates to the core of things but lingers
over the shows. Thus he has no grip of his present strength or of the
insignificance to which he relegates himself by his composition. For
Shakespeare differs from Plutarch, and follows Appian, in making his
rising a very serious matter.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
It is this that in the play, and in complete contradiction of the
<i>Life</i>, is the chief motive for Antony’s return to Italy: and he
gives his reasons. He says that Pompey “commands the empire of the
sea” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 191),—a great exaggeration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
of Plutarch’s statement that he “so scoored<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
all the sea thereabouts (<i>i.e.</i>, near Sicily) that none durst
peepe out with a sayle.” He continues, that “the slippery people” begin
to throw all the dignities of Pompey the Great upon his son
(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 193), though there is no hint of this
popular support in the history. And he concludes that Pompey’s</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent19">... quality, going on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sides o’ the world may danger.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 198.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In Plutarch it is not prudence but courtesy that moves the Triumvirs
to negociate with him. His hospitality to Antony’s mother is expressly
mentioned as the cause of their leniency; “<i>therefore</i> they
thought good to make peace with him.” Similarly Shakespeare may have
warrant from Appian, but he certainly has not warrant from Plutarch,
to represent Octavius as listening in dismay to reports of malcontents
“that only have fear’d Caesar” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iv. 38)
crowding to Pompey’s banners from love of him; or as harassed by
Antony’s absence, when this occasion “drums him from his sport”
(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iv. 29); or as driven by fear of
Pompey to “cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i. 48). In all these ways Shakespeare
treats the trifling disturbance of Plutarch’s account as a civil war
waged by not unequal forces. And even after the tension has been
somewhat relieved by Antony’s arrival, Octavius bears witness in regard
to Pompey’s strength by land that it is</p>

<p class="no-indent">Obviously then Shakespeare conceives Pompey as
having much to hope for, and much to lose. But Pompey does not realise
his own power. By the treaty he throws away his advantages. In the
division of the world he only gets Sicily and Sardinia, which were his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
already; and in return he must rid all the sea of pirates, and
send wheat to Rome. By the first provision he deprives himself of
recruits like Menas and Menecrates; by the second, he caters for
his scarce atoned enemies. Surely there is justification for Menas’
aside: “Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this treaty”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> vi. 84), and his like remark to
Enobarbus: “Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> vi. 109). He practically gives over the
contest which he has a fair prospect of winning, and allows himself to
be cajoled of the means by which he might at least gain security and
power. But the most that he obtains is a paper guarantee for a fraction
of the spoils; though he ought to have known that such guarantees
are rotten bands with rivals like Octavius, who will only wait the
opportunity, that must now inevitably come, to set them aside.</p>

<p>But besides, this magnanimity, which he is so fond of parading, is not
only insufficient, even were it quite sterling coin; in his case it
rings counterfeit. We cannot forget that his noble sentiments about
justice are uttered to Menas and Menecrates, “great thieves by sea.” Is
Pompeius Magnus to be avenged, is freedom to be restored by the help
of buccaneers who find it expedient to “deny” what they have done by
water? Surely all this is not very dexterous make-believe, intended
to impose on others or himself. Even his rejection of Menas’ scheme
for doing away with the Triumvirs, though it shows his regard for
appearances, does not imply any honourable feeling of the highest kind.
For listen to his words:</p>

Here he shows no moral scruple, but only anxiety about his reputation.
He would have no objection to reap the reward of crime, and would
even after a decorous interval approve it; but he will not commit or
authorise it, because he wishes to pose in his own eyes and the eyes
of others as the man of justice, principle and chivalry. He is one of
the people who “would not play false and yet would wrongly win,” and
who often excite more contempt than the resolute malefactor. And the
reason is that their abstention from guilt arises not from tenderness
of conscience but from perplexity of intellect. They confound shadow
and substance; for by as much as genuine virtue is superior to material
success, by so much is material success superior to the illusion of
virtue. In the case of Pompey, the treachery of Octavius is almost
excused by the ostentation, obtuseness, and half-heartedness of the
victim. It is fitting that after being despoiled of Italy he should
owe his death to a mistake. This at least is the story, not found in
Plutarch, which Shakespeare in all probability adopts at the suggestion
of Appian. It is not given as certain even by Appian, who leaves it
open to question whether he was killed by Antony’s command or not.
But perhaps Shakespeare considers that his futile career should end
futilely through the overzeal of an agent who misunderstands his
master’s wishes; so he makes Eros tell how Antony</p>

<p class="no-indent">It suits the dramatist too to free his hero from
complicity in such a deed, and exhibit him as receiving the news with
generous indignation and regret. Yet such regret is very skin-deep.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
Even Antony’s chief complaint in regard to Pompey’s overthrow is that
he gets none of the unearned increment; or, as Octavius says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent17">that, having in Sicily</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Higher still in our respect, if not in our affection, but even in
our respect not very high, is Octavius at the head of his statesmen,
politicians, men of the world, his Mecaenases, Agrippas and the rest,
with their <i>savoir faire</i> and <i>savoir vivre</i>. They never let
themselves go in thought or in deed; all their words and behaviour are
disciplined, reserved, premeditated. Antony’s description of their
principal is no doubt true, and it breathes the contempt of the born
soldier, who has drunk delight of battle with his peers, for the mere
deviser of calculations and combinations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Nor is there any prestige of genius or glamour of
charm to conciliate admiration for such men. Theirs are the practical,
rather uninteresting natures, that generally rise to the top in this
workaday world. They know what they wish to get; they know what they
must do to get it; and the light from heaven never shines on their eyes
either to glorify their path or to lead them astray.</p>

<p>The most obvious trait, as Kreyssig remarks, in the somewhat bourgeois
personality of Octavius is his sobriety, in every sense of the word: a
self-contained sobriety, which, though supposed to be a middle-class
virtue, is in him pushed so far as to become almost aristocratic. For
it fosters and cherishes his self-esteem; and his self-esteem rises to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
an enormous and inflexible pride, which finds expression alike in his
dignity and in his punctiliousness. In both respects it is outraged by
the levity of Antony, which he resents as compromising himself. His
colleague must</p>

<p class="no-indent">A man like this, fast centred in himself, cannot
but despise the impulse-driven populace; he could never have courted
it to sway it to his purposes, as Antony did of old; to him it is a
rotting water-weed. This temper, lofty and imposing in some respects,
is apt to attach undue importance to form and etiquette, as when the
“manner” of Enobarbus’ interruption, not its really objectionable
because all too incontrovertible matter, arouses his disapproval:
but it is a difficult temper to take liberties with. None of his
counsellors dreams of venturing with him on the familiarity which
Enobarbus, Canidius, and even the common soldier, employ as a matter
of course with Antony. And this is partly due to his lack of sympathy,
to his deficient social feeling. Such an one plumes himself on being
different from and superior to his fellows. He is like the Prince of
Arragon in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>:</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is because Antony’s vices are those of the

<p class="no-indent">His own failings do not lie in the direction of vulgar indulgence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
He is a foe to all excess. When the feasters pledge him, he objects to

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And he can address a dignified remonstrance and
rebuke to his less temperate associates:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What would you more?&emsp;Pompey, good night.&emsp;Good brother,</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vii. 126.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">A man of this kind will be externally faultless in
all the domestic requirements, a good husband and a good brother, in so
far as rigid fidelity to the nuptial tie and scrupulous care for his
sister’s provision are concerned. He is honestly shocked at Antony’s
violation of his marriage bond. We feel that if Cleopatra did really
entertain the idea of subduing him by her charms, it was nothing but an
undevout imagination. One might as well think to set on fire “a dish of
skim milk,” as Hotspur calls men of this sort.</p>

<p>But the better side of this is his genuine family feeling. His love
for his sister may be limited and alloyed, but it is unfeigned. It has
sometimes been pointed out that his indignation at Octavia’s scanty
convoy when she returns from Athens to Rome, is stirred quite as much
on his own behalf as on hers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vi. 42.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is quite true that he thinks of what is due to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
himself, but he does not altogether forget her claims; and even when
he regrets the defective “ostentation” of love—a term that is apt to
rouse suspicion, no doubt, but less so in Elizabethan than in modern
ears—he bases his regret on the just and valid ground that without
expression love itself is apt to die. That behind his own “ostentation”
of fondness (which of course he is careful not to neglect, for it is a
becoming and creditable thing), there is some reality of feeling, is
proved by the parting scene. His affectionate farewell and even his
gathering tears might be pretence; but he promises to send her regular
letters:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">Sweet Octavia,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You shall hear from me still.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 58.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It really means something when a man like
Octavius, busy with the affairs of the whole world, spares time for
frequent domestic correspondence.</p>

<p>And yet this admirable brother has not hesitated to arrange for his
sister a “mariage de convenance” with Antony, a man whom he disapproves
and dislikes. From the worldly point of view it is certainly the most
brilliant match she could make; and this perhaps to one of Octavius’
arid nature, with its total lack of sympathy, imagination and generous
ideals, may have seemed the main consideration. All the same we cannot
help feeling that he was thinking mainly of himself, and, though with
some regrets, has sacrificed her to the exigencies of statecraft. Menas
and Enobarbus, shrewd and unsentimental observers, agree that policy
has made more in the marriage than love. So much indeed is obvious,
even if its purpose is what on the face of it it professes to be, the
reconcilement of the men it makes brothers-in-law. But, as we shall
see, Octavius may have a more tortuous device in it than this.</p>

<p>Treating it meanwhile, however, as an expedient for knitting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
alliance with his rival, what inference does it suggest? If for the
sake of his own interests, Octavius shows himself far from scrupulous
in regard to the sister whom he loves and whose material well-being
is his care, what may we expect of him in the case of those who are
indifferent or dangerous or hostile?</p>

<p>He has no hesitation about ousting his colleague Lepidus, or ruining
the reconciled rebel Pompeius, despite his compacts with both. Then
it is Antony’s turn; and Antony is a far more formidable antagonist,
with all his superiority in material resources, fertility of genius,
proven soldiership and strategic skill. It is not because Octavius is
the greater man that he succeeds. It is, in the first place, because he
concentrates all his narrow nature to a single issue, while Antony with
his greater width of outlook disperses his interest on many things at
once. How typical of each are the asides with which respectively they
enter their momentous conference. Antony is already contemplating other
contingencies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If we compose well here, to Parthia:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hark, Ventidius.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 15.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Octavius will not be diverted from the
immediate business:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">I do not know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 16.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So, too, when the composition has taken place,
Antony squanders his strength in the invasion of Parthia, the conquest
of Armenia and other annexations, not to mention his grand distraction
in Egypt. But Octavius pursues his one purpose with the dogged tenacity
of a sleuth hound, removes Pompey who might be troublesome, seizes the
resources of Lepidus, and is able to oppose the solid mass of the West
to Antony’s loose congeries of Asiatic allies and underlings, whose
disunited crowd seems to typify his own unreconciled ambitions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span></p>

<p>But even so it is not so much that Octavius wins, as that Antony loses.
In another sense than he means, the words of the latter are true:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Not Caesar’s valour hath o’erthrown Antony,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Antony’s hath triumph’d on itself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xv. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is his extraordinary series of blunders,
perversities, and follies that play into his antagonist’s hands and
give him the trick, though that antagonist holds worse cards and is
less expert in many points of the game.</p>

<p>But in so far as Octavius can claim credit for playing it, it is due to
cunning and chicane rather than to any wisdom or ability of the higher
kind. At the outset he prepares a snare for Antony, into which Antony
falls, and by the fall is permanently crippled. It seems more than
probable that the marriage with Octavia was suggested, not to confirm
the alliance, but to provoke a breach at a more convenient season. The
biographer expressly assigns the same sort of ulterior motive to a
later act of apparent kindliness, when Octavia was again used as the
unconscious pawn. When she, just before the final breach, insists on
setting out to join her husband, Plutarch explains:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Her brother Octavius was willing unto it, not for
his (<i>i.e.</i> Antony’s) respect at all (as most authors doe report)
as for that he might have an honest culler to make warre with Antonius
if he did misuse her, and not esteeme of her as she ought to be.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This was quite enough to suggest to Shakespeare
a similar interpretation of the marriage project from the first. He
does not indeed expressly state but he virtually implies it, as appears
if we realise the characters and circumstances of those concerned. At
the time the match is being arranged, Enobarbus quite clearly foresees
and openly predicts the upshot to Mecaenas and Agrippa. Will they, and
especially Agrippa, who is nominal author of the plan and announces it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
as “a studied not a present thought,” have overlooked so probable an
issue? Will it never have occurred to the circumspect and calculating
Octavius, who evidently leads up to Agrippa’s intervention and
proposal? Or if through some incredible inadvertence it has hitherto
escaped them all, will not the vigilant pair of henchmen hasten to
inform their master of the unexpected turn that things seem likely to
take? Not at all. Despite the convinced and convincing confidence of
Enobarbus’ prophecy, they waive it aside. Mecaenas merely replies with
diplomatic decorum:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart of Antony, Octavia is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A blessed lottery to him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 247.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">No doubt. But though Touchstone says, “Your If
is your only peace-maker,” it can also be a very good peace-breaker
on occasion. In Enobarbus’ opinion (and in his own way Octavius is
just as shrewd), Octavia with her “holy, cold and still conversation”
is no dish for Antony. But though this is now expressly pointed out
to Octavius’ confidants, the marriage goes on as though nothing could
be urged against it. The reason is that nothing can, from the point
of view of the contrivers. If it turns out well, so far good; if it
turns out ill, so much the better. Only when it is an accomplished
fact, does Caesar give a glimpse of what it involves in the sinister
exhortation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let not the piece of virtue which is set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Betwixt us, as the cement of our love,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The fortress of it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 28.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thus when Antony returns to Cleopatra, as he was
bound to do, Octavius manages to represent himself as the aggrieved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
party, as champion of the sanctity of the hearth, the vindicator of
old Roman pieties; and in this way gains a good deal of credit at the
outset of the quarrel.</p>

<p>And for the fortunate conduct of it, he is indebted, apart from
Antony’s demoralisation, to his adroitness in playing on the weakness
of others, rather than to any nobler strength in himself. Thus he
irritates Antony’s reckless chivalry, both vain and grandiose, by
defying him to give battle by sea at Actium. Antony is not bound even
by any punctilio of honour to consent, for Octavius has twice declined
a similar challenge.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But Octavius knows his man, and this appeal to his
audacity, enforced by the command of Cleopatra, determines Antony like
a true knight-errant to the fatal course.</p>

<p>This passage is of great significance in Shakespeare’s delineation of
Octavius, because, though suggested by Plutarch, it completely alters
the complexion and some of the facts of Plutarch’s story. That records
the two-fold challenge of Antony, but represents it as answering, not
preceding the message of Octavius. Moreover that message contains no
reference to a naval combat and has nothing in common with the shape it
assumes in the play.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Octavius Caesar sent unto Antonius, to will him to
delay no more time, but to come on with his army into Italy: and that
for his owne part he would give him safe harber, to lande without any
trouble, and that he would withdraw his armie from the sea, as farre as
one horse could runne, until he had put his army ashore, and had lodged
his men.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
That is, in the original Octavius takes the lead in dare-devilry, and
seems voluntarily to suggest such terms as even Byrhtnoth at the Battle
of Maldon conceded only by request. Shakespeare could not fit this in
with his conception of the cold-blooded politician, and substitutes for
it a proposal that will put the enemy at a disadvantage; while at the
same time he accentuates Octavius’ unblushing knavery, by making him
apply this provocation after he has twice rejected offers that do not
suit himself.</p>

<p>Again, having won his first victory through Cleopatra’s flight, Caesar
cynically reckons for new success on her corruptibility:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in our name, what she requires; add more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From thine invention, offers: women are not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ne’er-touch’d vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xii. 24.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This scheme indeed miscarries owing to Antony’s
intervention, but meanwhile it has become unnecessary owing to the
torrent of deserters. So Octavius is sure of his case, and can dismiss
with ridicule the idea of a single fight. In Plutarch he does so too,
but with the implied brag that he would certainly be victor: “Caesar
answered him that he had many other wayes to dye then so;” when the
<i>he</i> stands for Antony: but owing to North’s fortunate ambiguity
Shakespeare takes it as referring to the speaker:</p>

<p class="no-indent">A more subtle contumely; for it implies that
Caesar with scornful impartiality acknowledges Antony’s superiority as
a <i>sabreur</i>, but can afford to dismiss that as of no moment. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
response has already been annotated in advance by Enobarbus, when
Antony was inditing his cartel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">His judgement too.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 29.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Octavius has by this time the ball at his feet,
and can even cast the contemptuous alms of his pity on “poor Antony,”
as he calls him (<span class="smcap">iv.</span> i. 16). Nor are his
expectations deceived, for he reckons out everything:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Go, charge Agrippa.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plant those that have revolted in the van,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Upon himself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 8.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And though he suffers a momentary check, he
presently achieves the final triumph through the treason and baseness
of Antony’s Egyptian followers, on which he rightly felt he might rely.</p>

<p>And when he has won the match he makes use of his advantage with more
appearance than reality of nobleness. He wishes to have not only the
substantial rewards of victory, but the shows and trappings of it as
well. He seeks to preserve Cleopatra alive,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent17">for her life in Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would be eternal in our triumph.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 65.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is the secret of his clemency and generosity,
that he would have her “grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels.”
And if he has another reason for sparing her, it is not for the sake
of clemency and generosity in themselves, but for the parade of these
qualities: as indeed Proculeius unconsciously lets out in the naïf
advice he gives her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do not abuse my master’s bounty by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The undoing of yourself: let the world see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His nobleness well acted, which your death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will never let come forth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 44.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
And ably does Octavius play his role: he “extenuates rather than
enforces,” gilds his covert threats with promises, and dismisses the
episode of the unscheduled treasure with Olympian serenity. His only
fault is that he rather overacts the part. His excess of magnanimity,
when by nature he is far from magnanimous, tells Cleopatra all she
needs to know, and leaves little for the definite disclosures of
Dolabella:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be noble to myself.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 191.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But, though not magnanimous, he is intelligent:
and his intelligence enables and enjoins him to recognise greatness
when it is no longer opposed to his own interest, and when the
recognition redounds to his own credit, by implying that the conqueror
is greater still. His panegyrics on Antony, and afterwards on
Cleopatra, are very nearly the right things to say and are very nearly
said in the right way. When he hears of his rival’s suicide, his first
exclamation does not ill befit the occasion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The breaking of so great a thing should make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A greater crack: ... the death of Antony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is not a single doom; in the name lay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A moiety of the world.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But this disinterested emotion does not last long.
The awe at fallen greatness soon leads to comparisons with the living
greatness that has proved its match. The obsequious bystanders find
this quite natural and point it out without a hint of sarcasm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Agr.</i><span class="ws8">Caesar is touch’d.</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He needs must see himself.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So Octavius proceeds to a recital of Antony’s merits
in which he bespeaks a double portion of the praise he seems to dispense:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">O Antony!</div>

    <div class="verse indent34">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 35.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And here, as business calls, he breaks off and
postpones the rest to “some meeter season.” Similarly when he finds
Cleopatra dead he has the insight to do her justice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">Bravest at the last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She levell’d at our purposes, and, being royal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Took her own way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 238.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then follows the official valediction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She shall be buried by her Antony:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No grave upon the earth shall clip in it</div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Strike those that make them</i>; and their story is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No less in pity than <i>his glory which</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Brought them to be lamented</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 361.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So the last word is a testimonial to himself.</p>

<p>These are eulogies of the understanding, not of the heart. They are
very different in tone from the tributes of Antony to his patron
Julius or his opponent Brutus. The tears and emotion, genuine though
facile, of the latter are vouched for even by the sarcasms of Agrippa
and Enobarbus. Octavius’ utterance, when he pronounces his farewell,
is broken, we may be sure, by no sob and choked by no passion. His
<i>éloge</i> has been compared to a funeral sermon, and will not
interfere with the victor’s appetite for the fruits of victory. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
though his feeling is not stirred to the depths, he is fairly just and
fairly acute. He is no contemptible character, this man who carries
off the palm from one of infinitely richer endowment. The contrast
between the two rivals, and the justification of the success of the
less gifted, is summed up in a couple of sentences they exchange at the
banquet off Misenum. When Octavius shrinks from the carouse, Antony
bids him: “Be a child o’ the time” (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> vii. 106).
“Possess it, I’ll make answer,” is Octavius’ reply and reproof.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span></p>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">MARK ANTONY</span></h3>
</div>

<p>“Be a child o’ the time,” says Antony, and he carries out his maxim
to the letter. Only that time could bring forth such a devotee of the
joys of life and lavish on him such wealth of enjoyment. But the time
was one that devoured its own children. Those who chose to be merely
its products, must accept its ordinances, and it was cruel as well as
indulgent. It was the manlier as well as the safer course for the child
to possess the time, to repudiate its stock, and, if might be, to usurp
the heritage.</p>

<p>We must bear the counter admonition of Octavius in mind when we
approach the personage to whom it was addressed. All who have a
wide range of interests, and with these warmth of imagination and
spontaneity of impulse, must feel that their judgment is apt to be
bribed by the attractions of Mark Antony. He is so many-sided, so
many-ways endowed, so full of vitality and vigour, potentially so
affluent and bright, that we look to find his life a clear and abundant
stream, and disbelieve our senses when we see a turbid pool that loses
itself in the sands. If we listen to the promptings of our blood, we
hail him as demi-god, but the verdict of our reason is that he is only
a futility. And both estimates base on Shakespeare who inspires and
reconciles them both.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span></p>

<p>Of course we are apt to carry with us to the present play the
impression we have received from the sketch of Antony in <i>Julius
Caesar</i>. And not without grounds. He is still a masquer and a
reveller, he is still a shrewd contriver. But we gradually become aware
of a difference. First, the precedence that these characteristics takes
is reversed. In <i>Julius Caesar</i> it is the contriving side of
his nature that is prominent, and the other is only indicated by the
remarks of acquaintances: in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, it is his
love of pleasure that is emphasised, while of his contrivance we have
only casual glimpses. And the contrast is not merely an alteration in
the point of view, it corresponds to an alteration in himself; in the
earlier drama he subordinates his luxury to his schemes, and in the
latter he subordinates his schemes to his luxury. But this is not all.
In the second place, his two main interests have changed in the degree
of what may be called their organisation. In <i>Julius Caesar</i> he
concentrates all his machinations on the one object of overthrowing
the tyrannicides and establishing his power; his pleasures, however
notorious, are random and disconnected dissipations without the
coherence of a single aim. In <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, however
manifold they may be, they are all subdued to the service of his master
passion, they are all focussed in his love for Cleopatra; while his
strategy is broken up to mere shifts and expedients that answer the
demand of the hour. Passion has become not only the regulative but the
constitutive force in his character.</p>

<p>When the action begins, he is indemnifying himself with a round of
indulgence for the strenuous life between the fall of Julius and the
victories at Philippi, some of the toils and privations of which,
passed over in the earlier play, Octavius now recalls in amazement at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
the contrast. It is not so strange. One remembers Professor von
Karsteg’s indictment of the English that they spare no pains because
they live for pleasure. “You are all in one mass, struggling in the
stream to get out and lie and wallow and belch on the banks. You
work so hard that you have all but one aim, and that is fatness and
ease!”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
Something similar strikes us in Antony. It is natural that action
should be followed by reaction and that abstinence should lead to
surfeit. It is doubly natural, when effort and discipline are not
prized for themselves or associated with the public good, but have
only been accepted as the means to a selfish aim. By them he has
acquired more than mortal power: why should he not use it in his own
behoof, oblivious of every call save the prompting of desire? A vulgar
attitude, we may say; but it is lifted above vulgarity by the vastness
of the orbit through which his desire revolves. It is grandiose, and
almost divine; in so far at least as it is a circle whose centre is
everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere. He has a gust for
everything and for everything in the highest degree, for each several
pleasure and its exact antithesis. In what does he not feel zest?
Luxury, banqueting, drunkenness, appeal to him, so that Pompey prays
they “may keep his brain fuming” (<span class="smcap">ii.</span>
i. 24). Or he acts the god, and with Cleopatra as Isis, dispenses
sovereignty from the “tribunal silver’d,” as they sit on their “chairs
of gold” (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> vi. 3). Or he finds a relish
in vulgar pleasures, and with the queen on his arm, mingles incognito
in the crowd, wandering through the streets “to note the qualities of
people” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 52). Or he goes a-fishing,
in which art he is a novice and presently becomes a dupe, when he pulls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
up the salt-fish “with fervency” (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> v. 18).
And a willing dupe, the conscious humorous dupe of love to his
tricksy enchantress, he is pleased to be in many other ways:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">That time,—O times!—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I laugh’d him out of patience; and that night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I laugh’d him into patience; and next morn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I wore his sword Philippian.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> v. 18.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In short his breathless pursuit of all sorts of
experiences more than justifies the scandalised summary of Octavius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">He fishes, drinks, and wastes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More womanly than he.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv. 4.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And he goes on to describe how Antony has been so
indiscriminate as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With knaves that smell of sweat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv. 17.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Yet, however he may seem to sink in his pleasures,
he is never submerged; such is his joyousness and strength that they
seem to bear him up and carry him along rather than drag him down. As
Cleopatra perceives:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">His delights</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were dolphin-like; they show’d his back above</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The element they lived in.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 88.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is this demand to share in all the
<i>Erdgeist</i> has to offer, that raises Antony above the level of the
average sensualist. His dissipations impose by their catholicity and
heartiness. His blithe eagerness never flags and nothing mundane leaves
him unmoved:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without some pleasure now.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 46.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
This is his ideal, an infinity of pastimes under the presidency of his
love; and any ideal, no matter what, always dignifies those whom it
inspires. But it also demands its sacrifice; and in the present case
Antony with a sort of inverse sublimity offers up to it all that the
ambitious, the honourable or the virtuous man counts good.</p>

<p>For a life like his is hardly compatible even in theory with the
arduous functions of the commander, the governor, the administrator;
and in practice it inevitably leads to their neglect. In the opening
scene we see him leave unheard the momentous tidings from Rome, and
turn aside to embrace his royal paramour. His followers are filled with
angry disgust:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, but this dotage of our general’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a tawny front.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The general voice cries out against him at home,

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">His newly arrived friends find the worst libels

    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 59.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Octavius is not unduly severe in his condemnation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
Nor is he without qualms himself. Sudden revulsions of feeling disturb
his riots when “a Roman thought hath struck him” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 87).
He feels that stopping short in his labours and relaxing his energy, he
gives his baser tendencies the sway, and cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">O, then we bring forth weeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When our quick minds lie still.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 113.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This, however, makes things worse rather than
better. It does not rouse him to any constant course, it only perplexes
his purpose. He does not wish to give up anything: the life at Rome and
the life at Alexandria both tug at his heart-strings; and he cannot see
that the Eastern and the Western career are not to be reconciled. It
is still nominally open to him to make a choice, but at any rate the
choice must be made. It must often have occurred to him to throw aside
his civil ties, and to set up as independent Emperor with his Egyptian
Queen. And apart from old associations there were only two reasons why
he should not: lingering respect for his marriage with Fulvia, whom in
a way he still loved, and dread of the avenging might of Rome directed
by all the craft of Octavius. These impediments are suddenly removed;
and their removal belongs to Shakespeare’s conception. It may be traced
in part to his own invention, in part perhaps to the suggestion of
Appian, but in any case it is of far-reaching significance.</p>

<p>In the biography the situation is fundamentally different, though
superficially alike. There Antony is threatened at once in the West
and the East. Octavius has driven his wife and brother out of Italy;
Labienus, the old foe of Caesarism, has led the Parthians into the
provinces. It is to meet these dangers that Antony leaves Egypt, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
the Parthian as the more pressing he addresses himself first. Only at
Fulvia’s entreaty does he alter his plan and sail for home with two
hundred ships; but her opportune death facilitates a composition with
Octavius. Then the alliance between them having been confirmed, and the
petty trouble with Sextus Pompeius having been easily settled, Antony
is able with ampler resources to turn against the troublesome Parthians.</p>

<p>These are the facts as Caesar narrates them; and according to them
Antony had no option but to break off his love affair and set out
to face one or both of the perils that menaced him; the peril from
Octavius who has defeated him in his representatives, the peril from
Labienus who has overrun the Near East. These items are not wanting in
Shakespeare, and as the news of them arrives, his Antony exclaims as
Plutarch’s might have done:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or lose myself in dotage.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 120.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But even as he speaks a second messenger arrives
who supplements the tidings of the first with new circumstances that
are really of much later date and quite different significance in
Plutarch, and that entirely alter the complexion of affairs. He hears
by word of mouth that Fulvia is dead, and, apparently by letter, that
Sextus Pompeius stands up against Caesar and commands the empire of
the sea. In Plutarch he is called to Rome by the fact not of Fulvia’s
being dead but of her being alive; and her death only prepares the way
for a reconciliation when he is already nearing home. Still less is
his return connected with the enterprise of Pompey which is mentioned
only after the reconciliation is accomplished, and, as we have seen,
is treated quite as a detail. But Shakespeare, inserting these matters
here and viewing them as he does, dismisses altogether or in part the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
motive which Plutarch implies for Antony’s behaviour. Indeed they
should rather be reasons for his continuing and proceeding further in
his present course. One main objection to his connection with Cleopatra
is removed, and the way is smoothed to marriage with his beloved. All
danger from Rome is for the time at an end; and the opportunity is
offered for establishing himself in Egypt while Pompey and Octavius
waste each other’s strength, or for making common cause with Pompey,
who, as we know, is well inclined to him and takes occasion to pay him
court.</p>

<p>But in Shakespeare’s Antony, the very removal of external hindrances
gives new force to those within his own heart. Regrets and compunctions
are stirred. The memory of his wife rises up with new authority, the
entreaties of his friends and the call of Rome sound with louder appeal
in his ears:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Not alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do strongly speak to us: but the letters too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of many our contriving friends in Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Petition us at home.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 186.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">With a man of his emotional nature, precisely the
opportunity so procured to carry out one set of his wishes, gives the
other set the mastery. Of his wife’s death he exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What our contempt doth often hurl from us,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By revolution lowering, does become</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The opposite of itself: she’s good, being gone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I must from this enchanting queen break off.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 126.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is no doubt the nobler and more befitting course that he proposes to
himself, but it is so only on the condition that he follows it out with
his whole heart. If he takes it up to let it go; if one half or more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
than one half of his soul lingers with the flesh-pots of Egypt, then
nothing could be more foolish and calamitous. He merely throws away
the grand chance of realising his more alluring ambition, and advances
no step to the sterner and loftier heights. For he will patch up the
Roman Triumvirate and rehabilitate the power of Octavius to his own
hurt, unless he resolves henceforth to act as a Roman Triumvir and
as the dominant partner with Octavius; and he will never again have
so good an occasion for legitimising and thus excusing his relation
with Cleopatra. This latter step was so obviously the natural one that
Octavius almost assumes he must have taken it. On making his proposal
for the match with Octavia, Agrippa says: “Great Antony is now a
widower,” but Octavius interrupts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Say not so, Agrippa:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were well deserved of rashness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 122.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But though he thus shrinks from the irrevocable
choice, we see clearly enough at his departure from Egypt that the
impulse towards Rome must soon be spent, and that therefore his refusal
to commit himself, and his whole enterprise, show rather weakness and
indecision than resolution and strength. To soothe Cleopatra he tells her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Be prepared to know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As you shall give the advice. By the fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from thence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As thou affect’st.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 66.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He is speaking too true when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Our separation so abides, and flies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thou, residing here, go’st yet with me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 102.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
And his last message runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To mend the petty present, I will piece</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her opulent throne with kingdoms: all the east,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say thou, shall call her mistress.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> v. 44.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And with these pledges like so many mill-stones
round his neck, he sets off to swim in the dangerous cross-currents
of Roman politics. It is true that pledges do not weigh over heavily
with him, but in this case their weight is increased by his inner
inclinations.</p>

<p>So the reconciliation with Octavius is hollow from the first, and being
hollow it is a blunder. Antony of course is able to blind himself to
its hollowness and to conduct the negociations with great adroitness.
His dignified and frank apology is just what he ought to say, supposing
that the particular end were to be sought at all, and it has an air of
candour that could not well be consciously assumed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">As nearly as I may,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So far ask pardon as befits mine honour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To stoop in such a case.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 91.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But this is only another instance of the born
orator’s faculty for throwing himself into a situation, and feeling for
the time what it is expedient to express. It is a fatal gift, which
betrays him oftener than it helps. If it prompts his moving utterances
over the bodies of Caesar and Brutus, and in so far directly or
indirectly assists his cause, it nevertheless even then to some cynical
observers like Enobarbus suggests a spice of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
not, but it comes almost to the same thing; for the easily aroused
emotion soon subsides after it has done its work and yields to some
quite contrary impulsion. But meanwhile the worst of it is, that it
carries away the eloquent speaker, and hurries him in directions and to
distances that are not for his good. With Antony’s real and permanent
bias, even a temporary reconcilement with Octavius is a mistake; but
what shall we say of his marriage with Octavia? Yet he jumps at it
at once; and with that convincing air of sincerity that can only be
explained by his really liking it for the moment, exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">May I never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Further this act of grace: and from this hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart of brothers govern in our loves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sway our great designs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 146.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And again he realises just what is proper to feel
and say to his betrothed, and says it so that we are sure he feels it
so long as he is speaking:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">My Octavia,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Read not my blemishes in the world’s report:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have not kept my square: but that to come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall all be done by the rule.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 4.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Yet she has barely left him, when, at the warning
of the soothsayer, and the thought of Octavius’ success in games of
chance and sport, he resolves to outrage the still uncompleted marriage
and return to his Egyptian bondage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent19">I will to Egypt:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For though I make this marriage for my peace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ the East my pleasure lies.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 38.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But when this is his fixed determination, why make
the marriage at all? Does he fail to see that it will bring not peace
but a sword? Yet he is so hood-winked by immediate opportunism that he
bears his share in making Pompey harmless to the mighty brother-in-law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
he is just about to offend. And knowing his own heart as he does, he
can nevertheless assume an air of resentment at the veiled menace in
Octavius’ parting admonition: “Make me not offended in your mistrust”
(<span class="smcap">iii.</span> ii. 33).</p>

<p>He has truly with all diligence digged a pit for himself. Already he
is the wreck of the shrewd contriver whose machinations Cassius so justly
feared. And this collapse of faculty, this access of presumption and
hebetude belong to Shakespeare’s conception of the case. In Plutarch
the renewed agreement of the Triumvirs is expedient and even necessary;
the marriage scheme is adopted in good faith and for a period serves its
purpose; the granting of terms to Pompey is an unimportant act of grace.</p>

<p>Nevertheless some powers of contrivance Shakespeare’s Antony still
retains. He despatches the capable Ventidius on the Parthian campaign,
and he has the credit and <i>éclat</i>, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">with his banners and his well-paid ranks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Are) jaded out o’ the field.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 32.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He himself over-runs and conquers Armenia, and
other Asiatic kingdoms, and with his new prestige and resources is
able to secure the support of a formidable band of subject kings. When
Octavia has returned to Rome and he to Egypt, and war breaks out, he is
still, thanks to these allies and to his own veteran legionaries whom
he has so often led to victory and spoil, the master of a power that
should more than suffice to make the fortune his.</p>

<p>But in his infatuation he throws all his advantages away. He pronounces
on himself the verdict which his whole story confirms:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">When we in our viciousness grow hard—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O misery on’t!—the wise gods seel our eyes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In our own filth drop our clear judgements; make us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Adore our errors; laugh at’s, while we strut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To our confusion.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 111.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
Of the preliminary blunder, which Plutarch signalises as “among the
greatest faults that ever Antonius committed,” viz., his failure to
give Octavius battle, when universal discontent was excited at home
by Octavius’ exactions, there is no mention, or only a very slight
and doubtful one in the play. When Eros has told the news of Pompey’s
overthrow and Lepidus’ deposition, Enobarbus at once foresees the sequel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And throw between them all the food thou hast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They’ll grind the one the other.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And presently he continues:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent13">Our great navy’s rigg’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eros.</i> For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My lord desires you presently; my news</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I might have told hereafter.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Eno.</i>             ’Twill be nought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But let it be. Bring me to Antony.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 20.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here we seem to have a faint reminiscence of
Plutarch’s statement. Eros takes for granted as the obvious course,
that the great navy ready to start will make an immediate descent
on the enemy’s stronghold. Enobarbus, who understands Antony, knows
that nothing will come of it, and that their destination is Egypt. In
point of fact we learn in the next scene that Antony has arrived in
Alexandria and there kept his state with Cleopatra.</p>

<p>But if Shakespeare glides over this episode, he dwells with all the
greater detail on the array of imbecilities with which Antony follows
it up. First, despite the advice of Enobarbus, he lets Cleopatra
be present in the war. Then to please her caprice, and gratify his
own fantastic chivalry, he sets aside the well-based objections of
Enobarbus, of Canidius, of the common soldiers; and accepts Octavius’
challenge to fight at sea, though his ships are heavy, his mariners
inexpert, and he himself and his veterans are more used to the dry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
land. Even so the inspiration of his soldiership and generalship is
giving him a slight superiority, when the panic of Cleopatra withdraws
her contingent of sixty ships:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom leprosy o’ertake!—i’ the midst o’ the fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When vantage like a pair of twins appear’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The breese upon her, like a cow in June,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hoists sail and flies.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> x. 10.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Not all is lost even then. But Antony follows
the fugitive, when, if he were true to himself, the day might
still be retrieved. This is the view that Shakespeare assigns to
Canidius; and while all the previous items he derived from Plutarch,
only distributing them among his persons, and adding to their
picturesqueness and force, this is an addition of his own to heighten
the ignominy of Antony’s desertion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Had our general</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> x. 25.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And the explanation of his “most unnoble
swerving,” if in one way an excuse, in another is an extra shame to
his manhood, and too well justifies Enobarbus’ dread of Cleopatra’s
influence:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take from his heart, take from his brain, from’s time,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What should not then be spared.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> vii. 11.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The authority for the idea that Antony was in a
manner hypnotised by her love, Shakespeare found, like so much else,
in the <i>Life</i>, but he enhances the effect immeasurably, first by
putting the avowal in Antony’s own lips, and again by the more poignant
and pitiful turn he gives it. Plutarch says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">There Antonius shewed plainely, that he had not
onely lost the corage and hart of an Emperor, but also of a valliant
man, and that he was not his owne man: (proving that true which an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
old man spake in myrth that the soule of a lover lived in another body,
and not in his owne) he was so caried away with the vaine love of this
woman, as if he had bene glued into her, and that she could not have
removed without moving of him also.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Antony cries in the play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt?...</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Thou knew’st too well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou shouldst tow me after: o’er my spirit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Command me....</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">You did know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How much you were my conqueror: and that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My sword, made weak by my affection, would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Obey it on all cause.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> x. 51.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But in Shakespeare’s view the final decision was
not reached even at the battle of Actium. Despite that disaster and the
subsequent desertions, Antony is still able to offer no inconsiderable
resistance in Egypt. In direct contradiction of Plutarch’s statement,
he says, after the reply to Euphronius and the scourging of Thyreus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent23">Our force by land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath nobly held; our sever’d navy too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 169.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Whether this be fact or illusion, it shows that
in his own eyes at least some hope remains: but in the hour of defeat
he was quite unmanned and seemed to give up all thought of prolonging
the struggle. When for the first time after his reverse we meet him in
Alexandria, he prays his followers to “take the hint which his despair
proclaims” (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> xi. 18), and to leave him,
with his treasure for their reward. This circumstance Shakespeare
obtained from Plutarch, but in Plutarch it is not quite the same. There
the dismissal takes place at Taenarus in the Peloponnesus, the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
stopping-place at which Antony touches in his flight, and apparently is
dictated by the difficulty of all the fugitives effecting their escape.
At any rate he was very far even then from despairing of his cause,
for in the previous sentence we read that he “sent unto Canidius, to
returne with his army into Asia, by Macedon”; and some time later we
find him, still ignorant of the facts, continuing to act on the belief
“that his armie by lande, which he left at Actium, was yet
whole.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
Here on the other hand he has succeeded in reaching his lair, and it is
as foolish as it is generous to throw away adherents and resources that
might be of help to him at the last. But he is too despondent to think
even of standing at bay. He tells his friends:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I have myself resolved upon a course</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which has no need of you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xi. 9.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That course was to beseech Octavius by his schoolmaster,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A private man in Athens.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xii. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here he touches the bottom mud of degradation and
almost sinks to the level of Lepidus who did obtain permission to live
under surveillance at Circeii “till death enlarged his confine.” And
here too Shakespeare follows Plutarch, but here too with a difference.
For in the biography this incident comes after some time has elapsed,
and new disappointments and new indulgences have made deeper inroads
in Antony’s spirit. In one aspect no doubt he is less pitiable in thus
being brought to mortification by degrees. In Shakespeare he adopts
this course before ever he has seen the Queen, and in so far shows
greater weakness of character. Like Richard II. he bows his head at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
once, and without an effort takes “the sweet way to despair.” Yet just
for that reason he is from another point of view less ignoble. It is
the sudden sense of disgrace, the amazement, the consternation at his
own poltroonery that turns his knees to water. But the very immediacy
and poignancy of his self-disgust is a guarantee of surviving nobility
that needs only an occasion to call it forth. The occasion comes in
the refusal of his own petition and the conditional compliance with
Cleopatra’s. Antony’s answer to this slighting treatment is his second
challenge. This too Shakespeare obtained from Plutarch, but of this
too he altered the significance and the date. In Plutarch it is sent
after Antony’s victorious sally, apparently in elation at that trifling
success, and is recorded without other remark than Octavius’ rejoinder.
In Shakespeare it is the retort of Antony’s self-consciousness to
the depreciation of his rival, and it is the first rebound of his
relaxed valour. When the victor counts him as nought he is stung to
comparisons, and feels that apart from success and external advantages
he is still of greater worth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Tell him he wears the rose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of youth upon him; from which the world should note</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May be a coward’s; whose ministers would prevail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under the service of a child as soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As i’ the command of Caesar: I dare him, therefore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To lay his gay comparisons apart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And answer me declined, sword against sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ourselves alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> xiii. 20.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Of course it is absurd and mad; and the madness
and absurdity are brought out, in the play, not in the <i>Life</i>,
by the comments of Enobarbus, Octavius and Mecaenas. Indeed at this
juncture Antony’s valour, or rather his desperation, does not cease
to prey on his reason. His insult to Caesar in the scourging of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
messenger is less an excess of audacity than the gnash of the teeth in
the last agony: as Enobarbus remarks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than with an old one dying.</div>

<p class="no-indent">Octavius may treat these transports of a great
spirit in the throes as mere bluster and brutality, and find in them a
warrant for his ruthless phrase, “the old ruffian.” There is a touch
of the ruffian in Antony’s wild outbursts. Even the mettlesome vein
in which he commands another gaudy night on Cleopatra’s birthday is
open to Enobarbus’ disparagement: that a diminution of his captain’s
brain restores his heart. Truly the last shreds of prudence are whirled
away in his storm of recklessness and anguish and love. At the defiant
anniversary feast his soul is so wrung with gratitude to his true
servants and grief at the near farewell, that he must give his feelings
words though they will discourage rather than hearten the company.
Cleopatra does not understand it, for her own nature has not the depth
of Antony’s, and deep can only call to deep. “What means this?” she asks.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Again, in amazement at his tearful pathos,
she exclaims: “What does he mean?” And with an effort at cynicism,
Enobarbus, who has scoffed at Antony’s emotion over the bodies of
Caesar and Brutus, replies: “To make his followers weep”; for Enobarbus
tries to think that it is merely the orator’s eloquence that runs away
with him in his melting mood. Nevertheless his own sympathies are
touched for the moment: “I, an ass, am onion-eyed.” In truth none can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
mistake the genuine feeling of Antony’s words, though at the hint
he can at once change their tone and give them an heroic and even a
sanguine turn.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii. 41.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But whatever deductions be made, Antony’s last
days in Alexandria bring back a St. Martin’s summer of genial power and
genial nobility that are doubly captivating when set off against the
foil of Caesar’s coldness. The grand proportions of his nature, that
are obscured in the vintage time of success and indulgence, show forth
again when the branches are bare. No doubt he again and again does the
wrong things, or at least the things that lead to no useful result. His
patron god deserts him as in Plutarch, but that god in Shakespeare is
not Bacchus but Hercules, and he departs earlier than in the story and
not on the last night before the end; for the withdrawal of the divine
friend is now less the presage of death than the symbol of inefficacy.
Antony’s insight and judgment may be failing; his flashes of power may
be like his flashes of jealousy, and indicate the dissolution of his
being. Still when all is said and done, he seems to become bolder,
grander, more magnanimous, as the fuel is cut off from his inward fire
and it burns and wastes in its own heat. His reflux of heroism cannot
save him against the material superiority and concentrated ambition of
Octavius, for it is not the consequent energy that commands success and
that implies a consequent purpose in life: but all the more impressive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
and affecting is this gallant fronting of fate. As Cleopatra
arms him for his last little victory, he cries with his old
self-consciousness:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then the morrow brings the end. His fleet deserts,
and for the moment he suspects Cleopatra as the cause, and overwhelms

But his mood changes. Even before he hears Cleopatra’s disclaimer and
the news of her alleged death, he has become calm, and only feels the
futility of it all; he is to himself “indistinct, as water is in water”
(<span class="smcap">iv.</span> xiv. 10). Then comes the message that
his beloved is no more, and his resolution is fixed:</p>

praise, and finds in his act a lesson.</p>

He has heard the truth about Cleopatra, and only importunes death
that he may snatch that one last interview sacred to his love of her,
his care for her, and to that serene, lofty dignity which now he has
attained. The world seems a blank when this full life is out; and
looking at the race that is left, we feel inclined to echo Cleopatra’s
words above the corpse:</p>

</div>

<p>To Cleopatra, the lodestar, the temptress, the predestined mate
of Antony, we now turn: and perhaps even Shakespeare has no more
marvellous creation than she, or one in which the nature that inspires
and the genius that reveals, are so fused in the ideal truth. Campbell
says: “He paints her as if the gipsy herself had cast her spell over
him, and given her own witchcraft to his pencil.” The witchcraft
everybody feels. It is almost impossible to look at her steadily, or
keep one’s head to estimate her aright. She is the incarnate poetry
of life without duty, glorified by beauty and grace; of impulse
without principle, ennobled by culture and intellect. But however
it may be with the reader, Shakespeare does not lose his head. He
is not the adept mesmerised, the sorcerer ensorcelled. Such avatars
as the Egyptian Queen have often been described by other poets, but
generally from the point of view either of the servile devotee or of
the unsympathetic censor. Here the artist is a man, experienced and
critical, yet with the fires of his imagination still ready to leap
and glow. He stands in right relation to the laws of life; and his
delineation is all the more impressive and all the more aesthetic, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
more remorselessly he sacrifices the one-sided claims of the conception
in which he delights to the laws of tragic necessity.</p>

<p>Cleopatra is introduced to us as a beauty of a somewhat dusky African
type in the full maturity, or perhaps a little past the maturity, of
her bloom. The first trait is for certain historically wrong.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
The line of the Ptolemies was of the purest Grecian breed, with a purity
of which they were proud, and which they sought to preserve by close
intermarriage within their house. But Shakespeare has so impressed his
own idea of Cleopatra on the world that later painters and poets have
followed suit ever since. Tennyson, in the <i>Dream of Fair Women</i>
tells how she summons him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I, turning, saw throned on a flowery rise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One sitting on a crimson scarf unroll’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A Queen with swarthy cheeks and bold black eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Brow-bound with burning gold.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Hawthorne in his <i>Transformation</i>, describing
Story’s statue of Cleopatra, which here he attributes to Kenyon, goes further:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The face was a marvellous success. The
sculptor had not shunned to give the full Nubian lips and the other
characteristics of the Egyptian physiognomy. His courage and integrity
had been abundantly rewarded: for Cleopatra’s beauty shone out richer,
warmer, more triumphantly beyond comparison, than if, shrinking timidly
from the truth, he had chosen the tame Grecian type.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Hawthorne goes astray through taking Shakespeare’s
picture, or rather another picture which Shakespeare’s suggested to
his own fancy, as a literal portrait; but his very mistake shows how
incongruous a fair Cleopatra would now seem to us.</p>

<p>Not often or obtrusively, but of set purpose and beyond the possibility
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
of neglect, does Shakespeare refer to her racial peculiarities. Philo
talks of her “tawny front” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 6),
and both he and Antony call her a gipsy with reference not merely
to the wily and vagabond character with which these landlopers in
Shakespeare’s day were stigmatised, but surely to the darkness of her
complexion as well. But the most explicit and the most significant
statement is her own:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">Think on me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> v. 27.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is one of her ironical exaggerations; but
does it not suggest something torrid and tropical, something of the
fervours of the East and South, that burn in the volcanic fires of
Othello and the impulsive splendours of Morocco? Does it not recall the
glowing plea of the latter,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mislike me not for my complexion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shadow’d livery of the burnish’d sun,</div>

    <div class="verse indent21">(<i>M. of V.</i>, <span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> i. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The sun has indeed shone on her and into her. She
has known the love and adoration of the greatest.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Broad-fronted Caesar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When thou wast here above the ground, I was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There would he anchor his aspect and die</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With looking on his life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> v. 29.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare magnifies the glories of her
conquests, for it was not Pompey the Great but his son who had been
her lover of old. But these experiences were only the preparation for
the grand passion of her life. She has outgrown them; and if the first
freshness is gone, the intoxication of fragrance, the flavour and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span> lusciousness are
enhanced. However much she believed herself engrossed by these early
fancies, now that she is under the spell of her Antony, her “man of
men,” she looks back on them as of her</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent26">salad days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When (she) was green in judgement, cold in blood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> v. 73.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Talking of her preparations to meet Antony,
Plutarch says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Gessing by the former accesse and credit she had
with Julius Caesar and Cneus Pompey (the sonne of Pompey the Great)
only for her beawtie; she began to have good hope that she might more
easily win Antonius. For Caesar and Pompey knew her when she was but a
young thing, and knew not then what the world ment: but now she went
to Antonius, at the age when a womans beawtie is at the prime, and she
also of best judgement.</p>

<p class="no-indent">“At the prime” are Plutarch’s words; for in point
of fact she was then twenty-eight years of age. In this Shakespeare
follows and goes beyond his authority; he gives us the impression
of her being somewhat older. Pompey talks of her contemptuously as
“Egypt’s widow,” and prays:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">All the charms of love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> i. 20.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">She herself in ironical self-disparagement avows
that she is “wrinkled deep in time” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span>
v. 29) and exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Though age from folly could not give me freedom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It does from childishness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 57.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But what then? Like Helen and Gudrun and the
ladies of romance, or like Ninon de Lenclos in actual life, she never
grows old. As even the cynical Enobarbus proclaims, “age cannot
wither her.” She has only gained skill and experience in the use
and embellishment of her physical charms, and with these the added
charms of grace, culture, expressiveness. She knows how to set off her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
attractions with all the aids of art, wealth and effect, as we see from
the <i>mise-en-scène</i> at the Cydnus: and her mobility and address,
her wit, her surprises, her range of interest do the rest. Again
Shakespeare has got the clue from Plutarch:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now her beawtie (as it is reported) was not so
passing, as unmatchable of other women,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
nor yet suche, as upon present viewe did enamor men with her; but
so sweete was her companie and conversacion, that a man could not
possiblie but be taken. And besides her beawtie, the good grace she had
to talke and discourse, her curteous nature that tempered her words and
dedes, was a spurre that pricked to the quick. Furthermore, besides all
these, her voyce and words were marvelous pleasant; for her tongue was
an instrument of musicke to divers sports and pastimes, the which she
easely turned to any language that pleased her. </p>

<p class="no-indent">In one respect Shakespeare differs from Plutarch;
he bestows on her surpassing and unmatchable beauty, so that she
transcends the artist’s ideal as much as that transcends mortal
womanhood; she o’er-pictures</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">that Venus where we see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fancy outwork nature.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> ii. 205.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But he agrees with Plutarch in making her beauty
the least part of her spell. Generally speaking it is taken for granted
rather than pointed out; and of its great triumph on the Cydnus we hear
only in the enraptured reminiscences of Enobarbus. Thus it is removed
from the sphere of sense to the sphere of imagination, and is idealised
in the fervour of his delight; but, though this we never forget, it
is of her other charms that we think most when she is present on the scene.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span></p>

<p>She is all life and movement, and never the same, so that we are
dazzled and bewildered, and too dizzy to measure her by any fixed
standard. Her versatility of intellect, her variety of mood, are
inexhaustible; and she can pass from gravity to gaiety, from fondness
to banter, with a suddenness that baffles conjecture. We can forecast
nothing of her except that any forecast will be vain. At her very first
entrance the languishing gives place in a moment to the exasperating vein:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 14.)</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His powerful mandate to you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 20.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">For she turns to account even the gibe and the
jeer, stings her lover with her venomous punctures, and pursues a
policy of pin-pricks not to repel but to allure. The hint comes from
Plutarch.</p>

<p class="blockquot">When Cleopatra found Antonius jeasts and slents
to be but grosse and souldier-like, in plaine manner; she gave it him
finely and without feare taunted him throughly.</p>

<p class="no-indent">And on the other hand she can faint at will, weep
and sob beyond measure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears: they
are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 152.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Here, too, the hint is given by Plutarch, but in a
later passage, when she fears Antony may return to Octavia:</p>

<p class="blockquot">When he went from her, she fell a weeping and
blubbering, looked rufully of the matter, and still found the meanes
that Antonius should often tymes finde her weeping.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In the play, when he announces his departure, she
is ready to fall; her lace must be cut; she plays the seduced innocent;
but she mingles wormwood with her pathos and overwhelms him with all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
sorts of opposite reproaches. Since he does not bewail Fulvia, that is
proof of infidelity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">O most false love!</div>

    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iii. 62.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When his distress is not to be confined, she taxes
him with mourning for his wife:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

grave and quiet dignity:</p>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iii. 99.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is the unexpectedness of her transitions, the
impossibility of foreseeing what she will say or do, the certainty that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
whatever she says or does will be a surprise, that keeps Antony and
everyone else in perpetual agitation.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
Tranquillity and dullness fly at the sound of her name. Her love relies
on provocation in both senses of the word, and to a far greater extent
in Shakespeare than in Plutarch. Thus Plutarch tells how Octavius’
expedition in occupying Toryne caused dismay among Antony’s troops:
“But Cleopatra making light of it: ‘And what daunger, I pray you,’ said
she, ‘if Caesar keepe at Toryne?’” On which North has the long marginal note:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The grace of this tawnt can not properly be
expressed in any other tongue, bicause of the equivocation of this
word Toryne, which signifieth a citie of Albania, and also, a ladell
to scoome the pot with: as if she ment, Caesar sat by the fire side,
scomming of the pot.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare makes no attempt to find an equivalent
for the untranslatable jest, but substitutes one of those bitter mocks
before which Antony has so often to wince. When he expresses wonder at
his rival’s dispatch, she strikes in:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Celerity is never more admired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than by the negligent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent17">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> vii. 25.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
And she does this sort of thing on principle. She tells Alexas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">See where he is, who’s with him, what he does:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I did not send you: if you find him sad,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I am sudden sick.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iii. 2.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Is it then all artifice? Are all her eddying
whims and contradictions mere stratagems to secure her sway? For a
moment Antony seems to think so. “She is cunning past man’s thought,”
he says in reference to her swooning: and perhaps it is because of
her cunning as well as her sinuous grace that his endearing name for
her is his “Serpent of old Nile” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> v. 25).
Enobarbus’ reply is in effect that her displays of emotion are too
vehement to be the results of art; they are the quintessence of
feeling: “her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of
pure love” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 151).</p>

<p>And both these views are correct. It is her deliberate programme to
keep satiety afar by the swiftness and diversity of the changes she
assumes; but it is a programme easy to carry out, for it corresponds to
her own nature. She is a creature of moods. Excitement, restlessness,
curiosity pulse in her life-blood. In Antony’s absence she is as
flighty with herself as ever she was with him. She feeds on memories
and thoughts of him, but they plague rather than soothe her. In little
more than a breathing-space she turns to music, billiards, and fishing;
and abandons them all to revel once in her day-dreams.</p>

<p>When the messenger arrives after Antony’s marriage, she in her
ungovernable eagerness interrupts him and will not let him disclose the
tidings for which she longs. When she hears what they are, she loses
all restraint; she stuns him with threats, curses, blows; she hales him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
by the hair and draws a knife upon him. Then, sinking down in a faint,
she suddenly recovers herself with that irrepressible vitality and
inquisitiveness of hers, that are bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Report the feature of Octavia, her years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her inclination, let him not leave out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The colour of her hair.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> v. 111.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And while we are still smiling at the last little
touch, comes that moving outburst of a sensitive and sorely stricken
soul:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Pity me, Charmian,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But do not speak to me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent19">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> v. 118.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Not long, however, is she in despair. Her
knowledge of Antony’s character, her knowledge of her own charms,
even her vanity and self-illusion combine to give her assurance of
final triumph; and when we next meet her, she is once more hopeful
and alert. “Why, methinks,” she sums up at the close of her not very
scientific investigation, “this creature’s no such thing”
(<span class="smcap">iii.</span> iii. 43); and she concludes,
“All may be well enough” (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> iii. 50).</p>

<p>The charm and piquancy of this nimble changefulness are obvious, and
it is not without its value as a weapon in the warfare of life. But it
is equally true that such shifting gusts will produce unreliability,
and even shiftiness. It is quite natural that Cleopatra, a queen
and the daughter of kings, should, in her presumptuous mood, insist
on being present in the campaign and on leading to battle her own
sixty ships. It is no less natural that amid the actual horrors of
the conflict, the luxuriously bred lady should be seized with panic
and take to flight. Indeed it is precisely what we might expect. For
despite the royalty of soul she often displays, there is in Cleopatra a
strain of physical timidity, for which Shakespeare has already prepared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
us. When the messenger of woe is to give his tidings to Antony, he hesitates and
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The nature of bad news infects the teller,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and Antony answers nobly and truly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When it concerns the fool or coward.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 99.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">We cannot help remembering Antony’s words when
Cleopatra visits on the bearer the fault of the bad news to her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wouldst appear most ugly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> v. 96.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Such a reception according to Antony stamps the
fool or the coward. Cleopatra is no fool, but there is a touch of
cowardice in her, that appears over and over again.</p>

<p>Thus it is perhaps fear, fear blended with worldliness, that gains a
hearing for Thyreus. There is absolutely no indication that she is
playing a part and temporising, out of faithfulness to Antony. She
had already sent her own private petition to Caesar, confessing his
greatness, submitting to his might, and requesting “the circle of the
Ptolemies” for her heirs. This, otherwise than in Plutarch, she had
done without Antony’s knowledge, who tells her, as though for her
information, that he had sent his schoolmaster to bear his terms; with
which Cleopatra’s were not associated. Her whole behaviour shows that
she dreads Octavius’ power, and dreads the loss of her own wealth and
dignities. But, in the scene with Thyreus, is she really prepared
to desert and betray her lover? Antony suspects that she is, and
appearances are indeed against her. Enobarbus believes that she is, and
Enobarbus generally hits on the truth. Yet we have always to remember
the temptation she would feel to try her spells on Thyreus and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
master: and even after Enobarbus’ desertion she remains with Antony,
clings to him, encourages him, arms him, is proud of him. In any
case it would not be cold-blooded perfidy, but one of those flaws
of weakness, of fear, of self-pity, of self-interest, that take her
unawares.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
For the final treason of the fleet at any rate, of which Antony
imagines her guilty, she seems in no way responsible. Plutarch mentions
Antony’s infuriated suspicion but adds no word in confirmation, and
Shakespeare, who would surely not have left us without direction on
so important a matter, is equally reticent. Such hints as he gives,
point the other way. We may indeed discount the disclaimers of Mardian
and Diomedes who would probably say anything they were told to say.
But when Antony greets Cleopatra, “Ah, thou spell! avaunt!” her exclamation,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Why is my lord enraged against his love?</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> xii. 31.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">seems to express genuine amazement rather than
assumed innocence. And in her conversation with her attendants her
words, to all appearance, imply that she cannot understand his rage: to
her it is merely inexplicable frenzy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Help me, my women! O, he is more mad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was never so emboss’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> xiii. 1.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Moreover, if she had packed cards with Caesar, it
is difficult to see why she should not claim a price for her treachery,
instead of locking herself up in the Monument as she does, and trying
to keep the Romans out. All the negociations and interviews after
Antony’s death seem to imply that she had no previous understanding
with Octavius.</p>

<p>But she recoils from her lover’s desperation, as she always does when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
he is deeply moved. She has ever the tact to feel the point at which
her blandishments and vexations are out of place and will no longer
serve her turn. Just as after the disaster of Actium she only sobs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">O my lord, my lord,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgive my fearful sails!</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> xi. 54.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and then can urge no plea but “pardon”; just as
after her interview with Thyreus, with no hint of levity, she solemnly
imprecates curses on herself and her offspring if she were false; so
now she bows before his wrath and flees to the monument. Then follows
the fiction of her death, a fiction in which the actress does not
forget the <i>finesses</i> of her art.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Say, that the last I spoke was “Antony,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And word it, prithee, piteously.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> xiii. 8.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is not the most candid nor dignified expedient,
but probably it is the most effective one; for violent ills need
violent cures; and perhaps there was nothing that could allay Antony’s
storm of distrust but as fierce a storm of regret. At any rate it
has the result at which Cleopatra aims; but she knows him well, and
presently foresees that the antidote may have a further working than
she intends. Diomedes seems to state the mere truth when he says that
her prophesying fear dispatched him to proclaim the truth.</p>

<p>But it is too late; and there only remains the lofty parting scene,
when if she still fears to open the gates lest Caesar should enter, she
draws her lover up to the monument, and lightens his last moments no
less with her queenliness than with her love. She feels the fitness and
the pathos in his ending, that none but Antony should conquer Antony:
she not obscurely hints that she will take the same path. When he bids her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety;</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> xv. 47.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
she answers well, “They do not go together.” Her passionate ejaculation
ere she faints above his corpse, her appeal to her frightened women,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">what’s brave, what’s noble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let’s do it after the high Roman fashion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> xv. 87.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">have a whole-heartedness and intensity that first
reveal the greatness of her nature.</p>

<p>And yet even now she seems to veer from the prouder course on which she
has set out. We soon find her in appearance paltering with her Roman
decision. She sends submissive messages to Caesar; she delays her death
so long that Proculeius can surprise her in her asylum; she accepts
her conqueror’s condescension; she stoops to hold back and conceal the
greater part of her jewels.</p>

<p>It is a strange riddle that Shakespeare has here offered to the
student, and perhaps no certain solution of it is to be found. In this
play, even more than in most, he resorts to what has been called his
shorthand, to the briefest and most hurried notation of his meaning,
and often it is next to impossible to explain or extend his symbols.</p>

<p>The usual interpretation, which has much to commend it, accepts all
these apparent compliances of Cleopatra for what on the face they
are. They are taken as instances of Shakespeare’s veracious art that
abstains from sophisticating fact for the sake of effect, and attains a
higher effect through this very conscientiousness and self-restraint.
Just as he makes the enthusiastic fidelity of Enobarbus fail to stand
the supreme test, so he detects a flaw in the resolute yearning
of Cleopatra. The body of her dead past weighs her down, and she
cannot advance steadily in the higher altitudes. She wavers in her
determination to die, as is implied by her retention of her treasure,
and “the courtesan’s instincts of venality and falsehood”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
still assert their sway. She has too easily taken to heart Antony’s advice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
and is but too ready, despite all her brave words, to grasp at her
safety along with her honour, or what she is pleased to consider her
honour to be. And, just as in the case of Enobarbus, an external
stimulus is needed to urge her to the nobler course. The gods in
their unkindness are kind to her. Dolabella’s disclosures and her own
observations convince her that Caesar spares her only for his own glory
and for her shame; that, as she foreboded, her safety and her honour do
not go together. Then, at the thought of the indignity, all her royal and
aristocratic nature rises in revolt, and she at last chooses as she ought.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is possible to maintain that all these apparent
lapses are mere subterfuges forced on Cleopatra to ensure the success
of her scheme; and this interpretation receives some support not only
from the text of the play, but from the comparison of it with North,
and a consideration of what in the original narrative Shakespeare takes
for granted, of what he alters, and of what he adds.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>After her more or less explicit statements in Antony’s death scene,
her suppliant message from the monument is an interpolation of the
dramatist’s; but so is the very different declaration which she
subsequently makes to her confidantes and in which her purpose of
suicide seems unchanged:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My desolation does begin to make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A minister of her will: and it is great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To do the thing that ends all other deeds;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which sleeps, and never palates more the dung,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The beggar’s nurse and Caesar’s.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
Which of these two utterances gives the true Cleopatra, the one
transmitted at second hand for Octavius’ consumption, or the one
breaking from her in private to her two women who will be true to
her till death? Quite apart from the circumstances in which, and the
persons to whom, they are spoken, there is a marked difference in
tone between the ceremonious official character of the first, and the
spontaneous sincerity of the second.</p>

<p>Then just at this moment Proculeius arrives and engages her in talk.
It is not wonderful that she should look for a moment to the man Antony
had recommended to her; but, though she is deferential to Octavius, her
one request is not for herself but for her son. And when the surprise
is effected, there is no question of the genuineness of her attempt
at self-destruction. Even when she is disarmed, she persists, as with
Plutarch, in her resolution to kill herself if need be by starvation.
In Plutarch she is dissuaded from this by threats against her children;
in Shakespeare events proceed more rapidly, and she has no time to put
such a plan in practice; nor is any serious use made of the maternal
“motif.” From first to last it is, along with grief for Antony,
resentment at the Roman triumph that moves her. And these feelings are
in full activity when immediately afterwards she is left in charge of
Dolabella. This passage also is an addition, and it is noteworthy that
it begins with her deification of Antony, and ends with Dolabella’s
assurance, which in Plutarch only follows later where the play repeats
it, of her future fate.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Cle.</i> He’ll lead me, then, in triumph?</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is just then that Caesar is announced; and it
is hard to believe that Cleopatra, with her two master passions excited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
to the height, should really contemplate embezzling treasure as
provision for a life which surely, in view of the facts, she could
not care to prolong. Moreover, in Plutarch’s narrative there is a
contradiction or ambiguity which North’s marginal note brings into
relief, and which would be quite enough to set a duller man than
Shakespeare thinking about what it all meant.</p>

<p class="blockquot">At length, she gave him a breefe and memoriall of
all the readie money and treasure she had. But by chaunce there stoode
Seleucus by, one of her Treasorers, who to seeme a good servant, came
straight to Caesar to disprove Cleopatra, that she had not set in al,
but kept many things back of purpose. Cleopatra was in such a rage with
him, that she flew upon him and tooke him by the heare of the head, and
boxed him wellfavoredly. Caesar fell a-laughing, and parted the fray.
“Alas,” said she, “O Caesar: is not this a great shame and reproche,
that thou having vouchsaved to take the peines to come unto me, and
hast done me this honor, poore wretche, and caitife creature, brought
into this pitiefull and miserable estate: and that mine owne servaunts
should come now to accuse me, though it may be I have reserved some
juells and trifles meete for women, but not for me (poore soule) to
set out my selfe withall, but meaning to geve some pretie presents and
gifts unto Octavia and Livia, that they making meanes and intercession
for me to thee, thou mightest yet extend thy favor and mercie upon me?”
Caesar was glad to heare her say so, <i>perswading him selfe thereby
that she had yet a desire to save her life</i>. So he made
her answere, that he did not only geve her that to dispose of at her
pleasure, which she had kept backe, but further promised to use her
more honorably and bountifully then she would thinke for: and so he
tooke his leave of her, <i>supposing he had deceived her, but in
deede he was deceived him selfe</i>.</p>

<p class="no-indent">And North underlines the suggestive clauses with
his comment:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cleopatra finely deceiveth Octavius Caesar, as
though she desired to live.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is not hard therefore to see how the whole
episode may be taken as contrived on her part. It would be a device of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
the serpent of old Nile, one of her triumphs of play-acting, by means
of which she gets the better of her conqueror and makes him indeed an
ass unpolicied. And though the suggestion would come from Plutarch,
whom Shakespeare follows in the main very closely throughout this
passage, it is pointed out that some of Shakespeare’s modifications in
detail seem to favour this view.</p>

<p>And to begin with it should be noticed that in all this episode
he passes over what is abject or hysterical or both in Plutarch’s
Cleopatra, and gives her a large measure of royal self-respect and
self-command. This is how Octavius finds her in the original story:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Cleopatra being layed upon a little low bed in
poore estate, when she sawe Caesar come in to her chamber, she sodainly
rose up, naked in her smocke, and fell downe at his feete marvelously
disfigured: both for that she had plucked her heare from her head,
as also for that she had martired all her face with her nailes, and
besides, her voyce was small and trembling, her eyes sonke into her
heade with continuall blubbering.</p>

<p>Thus, and with other traits that we omit, Plutarch describes her “ougly
and pitiefull state,” when Caesar comes to see and comfort her. We
cannot imagine Shakespeare’s Cleopatra ever so forgetting what was due
to her beauty, her rank, and herself. Then the narrative proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">When Caesar had made her lye downe againe, and
sate by her beddes side; Cleopatra began to cleere and excuse her
selfe for that she had done, laying all to the feare she had of
Antonius. Caesar, in contrarie maner, reproved<a id="FNanchor_223"
href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> her in every poynt.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In the play this suggestion is put back to the
interview with Thyreus; and is made, not refuted, on the authority of
Octavius.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Thy.</i> He knows that you embrace not Antony</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Sole sir o’ the world,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I cannot project mine own cause so well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make it clear: but do confess I have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Been laden with like frailties, which before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have often shamed our sex.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 120.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Even her wrath at Seleucus is less outrageous than
in Plutarch. She threatens his eyes, but does not proceed to physical
violence. She does not fly upon him and seize him by the hair of the
head and box him well-favouredly. These vivacities Shakespeare had
remarked, but he transfers them to the much earlier scene when she
receives news of Antony’s marriage and strikes the messenger to the
ground, and strikes him again, and drags him up and down. Now she has
somewhat more self-control, and is no longer carried beyond all limits
of decency by her ungovernable moods. Shakespeare, therefore, gives her
a new dignity and strength even in this most equivocal scene; and how
could these be reconciled with a craven hankering for life and a base
desire to retain by swindling a share of its gewgaws?</p>

<p>But a further alteration, we are told, gives a definite though
unobtrusive hint that all the while she is in collusion with Seleucus,
and that the whole affair is a comedy arranged between them to keep
open the door of death. Not only does the treasurer escape unpunished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
after his disclosure, but he is invited to make it. In Plutarch he
merely happens to stand by, and intervenes “to seeme a good servant.”
Here Cleopatra calls for him; bids Caesar let him speak on his peril;
and herself orders him, “Speak the truth, Seleucus.”</p>

<p>Moreover his statement and her excuse point to a much more serious
embezzlement than Plutarch suggests, and just in so far would give
Octavius a stronger impression of her desire to live. In the biography
Seleucus confines himself to saying that “she had not set in al,
but kept many things back of purpose”: and she confesses only to
“some juells and trifles meete for women ... meaning to geve some
pretie presents and gifts unto Octavia and Livia.” In the play to her
question: “What have I kept back?” Seleucus answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Enough to purchase what you have made known:</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 148.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and she, after the express proviso she makes in
advance, that she has not admitted petty things in the schedule, now
acknowledges that she has reserved not only “lady trifles, immoment
toys“—these were already accounted for—but some “nobler token” for
Octavius’ sister and wife.</p>

<p>If these clues are unduly faint, we are reminded that such elliptical
treatment is not without parallel in other incidents of the drama.
Octavius’ policy in regard to Octavia’s marriage, for example, has, in
just the same way, to be gathered from the general drift of events and
the general probabilities of the case, from an unimportant suggestion
in Plutarch, from the opportunity furnished to Agrippa, and his agency
in that transaction, which are not more explicit than the opportunity
furnished to Seleucus, and his agency in this.</p>

<p>These arguments are ingenious and not without their cogency, but they
leave one unconvinced. The difficulties in accepting them are far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span>
greater than in the analogous question of Antony’s marriage. For in
the latter the theory of Octavius’ duplicity does not contradict the
impression of the scene. Nor does it contradict but only supplements
the statement of the historian: the utmost we can say is that it is not
made sufficiently prominent. And, lastly, the doubt that is thus left
possible does not concern a protagonist of the drama, but at most the
chief or one of the chief of the minor characters. But in the present
case the impression produced on the unsophisticated reader is certainly
that Cleopatra is convicted of fraud: and however that impression may
be weakened by a review of the circumstances as a whole, there is no
single phrase or detail that brings the opposite theory home to the
imagination. Besides, the complicity of Seleucus would be a much bolder
fabrication than the complicity of Agrippa: the latter is not recorded,
but the opposite of the former is recorded, and was accepted by all
who dealt with this episode from Jodelle to Daniel, and probably by
all who read Plutarch: the treasurer was present by accident and used
the opportunity to ingratiate himself. So Shakespeare, without giving
adequate guidance himself, would leave people to the presuppositions
they had formed under the guidance of his author. Surely this is a very
severe criticism on his art. But this is not all. The misconstruction
which he did nothing to prevent and everything to produce, would
concern the heroine of the piece, an even more important personage than
the hero, as is shown by her receiving the fifth act to herself, while
Antony is dismissed in the fourth.</p>

<p>These objections, however, only apply to the view that the suppression
and discovery of the treasure were parts of a deliberate stratagem.
They do not affect the arguments that Cleopatra has virtually accepted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
death as the only practical solution, and that the rest of her
behaviour at this stage accords ill with mercenary imposture.</p>

<p>In a word both these antagonistic theories approve themselves in so
far as they take into account the facts alleged and the impressions
produced by the drama. If we credit our feelings, it is quite true
that Cleopatra is taken by surprise and put out of countenance, that
she seeks to excuse herself and passionately resents the disloyalty of
Seleucus. And again, if we credit our feelings, it is quite true that
from the time the mortally wounded Antony is brought before her, she
has made up her mind to kill herself, and that she is nobler and more
queenly for her decision than she was before or than Plutarch makes her.</p>

<p>Of course, buoyant and versatile, feeling her life in every limb, and
quick to catch each passing chance, she may even now without really
knowing it, without really believing it, have hoped against hope that
she might still obtain terms she could accept undisgraced. And the hope
of life would bring with it the frailties of life, for clearly it is
only the resolve to die that lifts her above herself. So here we should
only have another instance of the complexity of her strange nature that
can consciously elect the higher path, and yet all the while in its
secret councils provide, if it may be, for following the lower.</p>

<p>But is there not another interpretation possible? What are these “lady
trifles” and “nobler tokens” that together would purchase all the
wealth of money, plate and jewels she has declared. Plutarch, talking
of her magnificence when she obeyed Antony’s first summons, evidently
does not expect to be believed, and adds that it was such “as is
credible enough she might bring from so great a house, and from so
wealthie a realme as Ægypt was.” And now she is “again for Cydnus,” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>
needs her “crown and all.” Already to all intents and purposes she has
resolved on her death, as is shown by her frequent assurances. She has
also resolved on the means of it; for scarcely has Caesar left, than
she tells Charmian:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I have spoke already, and it is provided.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 195.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Will she not also have resolved on the manner of
it; and both in the self-consciousness of her beauty and in memory
of her first meeting with Antony, does she not desire to depart life
for the next meeting with due pomp and state? If we imagine she was
keeping back her regalia for this last display, we can understand why
Shakespeare inserted the “nobler token” in addition to the unconsidered
trifles which she was quite ready to own she had reserved, and of which
indeed in Shakespeare though not in Plutarch she had already made
express mention as uninventoried.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> We can understand her consternation and resentment
at the disclosure; for just as in regard to the “nobler token” she
could not explain her real motives without ruining her plan. And we can
admire her “cunning past man’s thought” in turning the whole incident
to account as proof that she was willing to live on sufferance as
<i>protégée</i> of Caesar.</p>

<p>No doubt this suggestion is open to the criticism that it is nowhere
established by a direct statement; but that also applies to the most
probable explanation of some other matters in the play. And meanwhile I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
think that it, better than the two previous theories we have discussed,
satisfies the conditions, by conforming with the <i>data</i> of the
play, the treatment of the sources, and the feelings of the reader. On
the one hand it fully admits the reality of Cleopatra’s fraud and of
her indignation at Seleucus. On the other it removes the discrepancy
between her dissimulation, and the loftiness of temper and readiness
for death, which she now generally and but for the usual interpretation
of this incident invariably displays. It tallies with what we may
surmise from Shakespeare’s other omissions and interpolations; and if
it goes beyond Plutarch’s account of Caesar’s deception by Cleopatra,
it does not contradict it, and therefore would not demand so full and
definite a statement as a new story entirely different from the original.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, there is at least no trace of hesitation or
compliance in the Queen from the moment when she perceives that
Octavius is merely “wording” her. Her self-respect is a stronger or,
at any rate, a more conspicuous motive than her love. Antony, when he
believed her false had said to her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">These words of wrath have lingered in her memory

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
The loathsomeness of the prospect grows in her imagination, and
compared with it the most loathsome fate is desirable. She tells
Proculeius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Know, sir, that I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will not wait pinion’d at your master’s court;</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 52.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And now in the full realisation of the scene, she
brings it home to her women:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cle.</i><span class="ws4">Now, Iras, what think’st thou?</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Rome, as well as I: mechanic slaves</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Iras.</i><span class="ws8">The gods forbid!</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Cle.</i> Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ballad us out of tune.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 207.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Such thoughts expel once for all her mutability
and flightiness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My resolution’s placed and I have nothing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of woman in me: now from head to foot</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 238.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And the scene that follows with the banalities
and trivialities of the clown who supplies the aspics among the figs,
brings into relief the loneliness of a queenly nature and a great
sorrow. Yet not merely the loneliness, but the potency as well. Who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
would have given the frivolous waiting-women of the earlier scenes
credit for devotion and heroism? Yet inspired by her example they learn
their lesson and are ready to die as nobly as she. Iras has spoken for
them all:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we are for the dark.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 193.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Now she brings the robe and crown Cleopatra wore
at Cydnus, and then, like Eros, ushers the way. Charmian stays but to
close the eyes and arrange the diadem of her dead mistress:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Downy windows, close;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And golden Phoebus never be beheld</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll mend it, and then play.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 319.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thereupon she too applies the asp and provokes
its fang.</p>

    <div class="verse indent13">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 325.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Even in the last solemn moment there is vanity,
artifice, and voluptuousness in Cleopatra. She is careful of her looks,
of her state, of her splendour, even in death; and doubtless would have
smiled if she could have heard Caesar’s tardy praise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 349.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And she does not depart quite in the high Roman fashion. She has
studied to make her passage easy, and has taken all measures that may
enable her to liken the stroke of death to a lover’s pinch and the
biting of the asp to the suckling of a babe, and to say:</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Hitherto this discussion of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> has so far as
possible passed over the most distinctive thing in the history of the
hero and heroine, the fatal passion that binds them together, gives
significance to their lives, and makes their memories famous. Knowing
their environment and their nature we are in a better position to see
in some measure what it meant.</p>

<p>We have noted how in that generation all ties of customary morality
are loosed, how the individual is a law to himself, and how
selfishness runs riot in its quest of gratification, acquisition,
material ambition. Among the children of that day those make the
most sympathetic impression who import into the somewhat casual
and indefinite personal relations that remain—the relation of the
legionary to his commander, of the freedman to his patron, of the
waiting-woman to her mistress—something of universal validity and
worth. But obviously no connection in a period like this at once arises
so naturally from the conditions, and has the possibilities of such
abiding authority, as the love of the sexes. On the one hand it is
the most personal bond of all. Love is free and not to be compelled.
It results from the spontaneous motion of the individual. Were we to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
conceive the whole social fabric dissolved, men and women would still
be drawn together by mutual inclination in more or less permanent
unions of pairs. And yet this attraction that seems to be and that is
so completely dictated by choice, that is certainly quite beyond the
domain of external compulsion, is in another aspect quite independent
of the will of the persons concerned, and sways them like a resistless
natural force. It has been said that the highest compliment the lover
can pay the beloved is to say, “I cannot help loving you.” Necessity is
laid upon him, and he is but its instrument. If then the inclination
is so pervasive and imperious that it becomes a master passion,
clearly it will supply the grand effective bond when other social
bonds fail. When nothing else can, it will enable a man and woman to
overleap a few at least of the barriers of their selfishness, and in
some measure to merge their egoism in sympathy. This is what justifies
Antony’s idolatry of Cleopatra to our feelings. The passion is
enthusiastic, and in a way is self-forgetful; and passion, enthusiasm,
self-forgetfulness, whatever their aberrations, always command respect.
They especially do so in this world of greeds and cravings and
calculating self-interest. This infinite devotion that shrinks from no
sacrifice, is at once the greatest thing within Antony’s reach, and
witness to his own greatness in recognising its worth. The greatest
thing within his reach: when we remember what the ambitions of his
fellows and his rivals were, there is truth in the words with which he
postpones all such ambitions to the bliss of the mutual caress:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the ranged empire fall!&emsp;Here is my space.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is to do thus: when such a mutual pair&emsp;(<i>embracing</i>)</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And such a twain can do’t, in which I bind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On pain of punishment, the world to weet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We stand up peerless.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 33.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And only one of grand general outlook could feel
like this, when he had tasted the sweets of conquest and power, and
when all the kingdoms of the world were reached to his hand as the
alternative for the kingdom of his love. It takes a hero, with such
experiences behind him and such opportunities before, to make the
disastrous choice. Heine tells us how he read Plutarch at school and
how the master “impressed on us that Antony for this woman spoiled his
public career, involved himself in domestic unpleasantnesses, and at
last plunged himself in ruin. In truth my old master was right, and it
is extremely dangerous to establish intimate relations with a person
like Cleopatra. It may be the destruction of a hero; but only of a
hero. Here as everywhere there is no danger for worthy mediocrity.”</p>

<p>But despite the sympathy with which Shakespeare regards Antony’s
passion both as an object of pursuit and as an indication of nobility,
he is quite aware that it is pernicious and criminal. Relatively it may
be extolled: absolutely it must be condemned. It is rooted in breach
of troth and duty, and it bears within itself the seeds of infidelity
and wrong. It has none of the inviolability and security of a lawful
love. After all, Cleopatra’s gibes about Antony’s relations with “the
married woman” and herself, despite their affectation of petulance, are
only too much to the point, so far as he is concerned; and when she has
yielded to Julius, Pompey, and Antony in turn, what guarantee has the
last favourite that she will not do so again to some later supplanter?
In point of fact each is untrue to the other, Antony by his marriage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
with Octavia, Cleopatra by her traffickings with Octavius and
Thyreus.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
She forfeits in the sequel her right to be angry at his truancy; he has
forfeited in advance the right to be angry at hers. But it is their
penalty that these resentments should come between them; and at the
very time when they most need each other’s support, their relation,
being far from the perfect kind that casts out mistrust, is vitiated
by jealousy on the one side and fear on the other. She flees to the
Monument, shuts herself up from his blind rage in craven panic, and
seeks to save her life by lies. At the sight of the liberties she has
allowed Thyreus to take, he loses himself in mad outbursts which have
but a partial foundation in the facts. Then he jumps to the conclusion
that she has arranged for the desertion of the sailors, and dooms her
to death, when in reality she seems to know nothing about it.</p>

<p class="no-indent">These terrors and suspicions are inevitable in
such love as theirs.</p>

<p>Or is their feeling for each other to be called love at all? The
question has been asked even in regard to Antony. From first to last he
is aware not only of her harmfulness but of her pravity. He is under no
illusions about her cunning, her boggling, her falsity. And can this
insight co-exist with devotion?</p>

<p>Much more frequently it has been asked in regard to Cleopatra. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span>
frankly avows even in retrospect her policy of making him her prey.
Thus does she mimic fact in her pastime:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Or, if other motives supervene, they belong to
wanton whim and splendid coquetry. Her deliberate allurements, her
conscious wiles, her calculated tenderness, are all employed merely to
retain her command of the serviceable instrument, and at the same time
minister to her vanity, since Antony would accept such a rôle only from her.</p>

<p>If both or either of these theories were adopted, the whole interest
and dignity of the theme would be gone. If Antony were not genuinely
in love, his follies and delinquencies would cast him beyond the pale
of our tolerance. If Cleopatra were not genuinely in love, she would
at best deserve the description of Ten Brink, “a courtesan of genius.”
If the love were not mutual, Antony would be merely the toy of the
courtesan, Cleopatra merely the toy of the sensualist.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span></p>

<p>But in point of fact, it is mutual and sincere. Antony’s feeling has to
do with much more than the senses. It goes deeper and higher; and even
when he doubts Cleopatra’s affection, he never doubts his own:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> xiv. 16.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Cleopatra’s feeling may have originated in
self-interest and may make use of craft. But in catching Antony she has
been caught herself; and though interest and vanity are not expelled,
they are swallowed up in vehement admiration for the man she has
ensnared. Her artifices are successful, because they are the means made
use of by a heart that is deeply engaged; and it is no paradox to say
that they are evidence of her sincerity. So often as she refers to her
lover seriously, it is with something like adoration. After the first
separation, he is her “man of men.” In her first bitterness at his
marriage, she cannot let him go, for</p>

<p class="no-indent">Even when he is fallen and worsted, she has no

and his rival. When he returns from his last victory, she greets him:
“Lord of lords! O infinite virtue!” (<span class="smcap">iv.</span>
viii. 16). When he dies, the world seems to her “no better than a
sty” (<span class="smcap">iv.</span> xv. 62). When she recalls his
splendour, his bounty, his joyousness, it seems not a reality, but a
dream, which yet must be more than a dream.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Various interpretations have been given of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
lines, but on any possible interpretation they exalt Antony alike
above fact and fancy.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
And when we run through the whole gamut of the words and deeds of the
pair, from their squabbles to their death, it seems to me possible to
doubt their love only by isolating some details and considering them to
the exclusion of the rest.</p>

<p>But the truth is that the love of Antony and Cleopatra is genuine and
intense; and if it leads to shame as well as to glory, this is to be
explained, apart from the circumstances of the time, apart from the
characters of the lovers, in the nature of the variety to which it belongs.</p>

<p>Plutarch, whose thoughts when he is discussing such subjects are never
far from Plato’s, has a passage in which he characterises Antony’s
passion by reference to the famous metaphor in the <i>Phaedrus</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In the ende, the horse of the minde, as Plato
termeth it, that is so hard of rayne (I meane the unreyned lust
of concupiscence), did put out of Antonius’ heade all honest and
commendable thoughts.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Certainly it is not the milder and more docile
steed that takes the lead in Antony’s affection. But it is perhaps a
little surprising that Plutarch did not rather go for his Platonic
illustration to the <i>Symposium</i>, where the disquisitions of
Aristophanes and Diotima explain respectively what Antony’s love is
and is not. Aristophanes, with his myth that men, once four-legged and
four-armed, were split in two because they were too happy, and now are
pining to find their counterparts, gives the exact description of what
the love of Antony and Cleopatra is.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">Each of us when separated is but the indenture of
a man, having one side only like a flat-fish, and he is always looking
for his other half.... When one of them finds his other half, ... the
pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and
one will not be out of the other’s sight, as I may say, even for a
moment.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">And, on the other hand, Diotima’s opposite theory
does not apply to this particular case, at least, to begin with or
superficially:</p>

<p class="blockquot">You hear people say that lovers are seeking for
their other half; but I say that they are seeking neither for the half
of themselves, nor for the whole, unless the half or the whole be also
a good. And they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them
away, if they are evil.... For there is nothing which men love but the
good.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>We may put the case in a somewhat more popular and modern fashion. All
love that really deserves the name must base more or less completely on
sympathy, on what Goethe called <i>Wahlverwandschaft</i>, or elective
affinity. But such affinity may be of different kinds and degrees,
and according to its range will tend to approximate to one of two
types. It may mean sympathy with what is deepest and highest in us,
our aspiration after the ideal, our bent towards perfection; or it
may mean sympathy with our whole nature and with all our feelings and
tendencies, alike with those that are high and with those that are low.
The former is the more exacting though the more beneficent. It implies
the suppression and abnegation in us of much that is base, of much that
is harmless, of much, even, that may be good, for the sake of the best.
In it we must inure ourselves to effort and sacrifice for the sake of
advance in that supersensible realm where the union took place.</p>

<p>The second is less austere, and, for the time being, more
comprehensive. It is founded on a correspondence in all sorts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span>
matters, great and small, noble and base, of good or of bad report. If
it lacks the exclusive loftiness of the other, it affords many more
points of contact and a far greater wealth of daily fellowship. And
of this latter variety, the love of Antony and Cleopatra is perhaps
the typical example. At first sight it is evident that they are, as
we say, made for each other. They are both past the first bloom of
youth. Cleopatra, whom at the outset Plutarch makes twenty-eight years
of age, and of whose wrinkles and waned lip Shakespeare, though in
irony and exaggeration, finds it possible to speak, has relatively
reached the same period of life as Antony, whom Plutarch makes at the
outset forty-three or forty-six years of age, and whom Shakespeare
represents as touched with the fall of eld. And they correspond in
their experiences. Neither is a novice in love and pleasure: Cleopatra,
the woman with a history, Antony, the masquer and reveller of Clodius’
set, have both seen life. They are alike in their emotionalism, their
impressibility, their quick wits, their love of splendour, their genial
power, their intellectual scope, their zest for everything. Plutarch
narrates—and it is strange that <i>à propos</i> of this he did not
quote Aristophanes’ saying in the <i>Symposium</i>—</p>

<p class="blockquot">She, were it in sport, or in matter of earnest,
still devised sundrie new delights to have Antonius at commaundement,
never leaving him night nor day, nor once letting him go out of her
sight. For she would play at dyce with him, drinke with him, and hunt
commonly with him, and also be with him when he went to any exercise
or activity of body. And sometime, also, when he would goe up and
downe the citie disguised like a slave in the night, and would peere
into poore men’s windowes and their shops, and scold and brawle with
them within the house: Cleopatra would be also in a chamber-maides
array, and amble up and downe the streets with him, so that oftentimes
Antonius bare away both mockes and blowes.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Here we have a picture of the completest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
<i>camaraderie</i> in things serious and frivolous, athletic and
intellectual, decorous and venturesome, with memories of which the play
is saturated. We are witnesses of Cleopatra’s impatience when he is
away for a moment: we hear of her drinking him to bed before the ninth
hour, and of their outdoor sports. Antony proposes to roam the streets
with her and note the qualities of the people. Perhaps it was some such
expedition that gave Enobarbus material for his description:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">I saw her once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hop forty paces through the public street;</div>

    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 233.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is such doings that raise the gorge of the genteel Octavius, who has
no sense for popular pleasures, whether we call them simple or vulgar.
But the daughter of the Ptolemies is less fastidious, and is as ready
as Antony to escape from the etiquette of the court and take her share
in these unceremonious frolics. Yet it is not only these lighter moods
and moments that draw them together. In the depth of his mistrust,
Antony recalls the “grave charm” of his enchantress; and she, when he
is no more, remembers that</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But what of serious and elevated they have in
common gains warmth and colour by their mutual delight in much that is

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
It is as genuine and catholic admiration as Florizel’s for Perdita:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent19">What you do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Still betters what is done....</div>

    <div class="verse indent24">(<i>W.T.</i> <span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> iv. 135.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But apart from their sincerity and range,
how different are the two tributes: Florizel’s all innocence and
simplicity, Antony’s <i>raffiné</i> and sophisticated. We feel from his
words that he would endorse Shakespeare’s ambiguous praise of his own
dark lady:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That in the very refuse of thy deeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is such strength and warrantise of skill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<i>Sonnet</i> <span class="smcap">cl.</span> 5.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Does not Enobarbus speak in almost exactly the
same way of the Cleopatra that Antony adores?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Vilest things</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Become themselves in her; that the holy priests</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bless her when she is riggish.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 243.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thus the two are alike not only in great and
indifferent things, but in their want of steadfastness, their want of
principle, their compliance with baseness. Hence they encourage each
other in what debilitates and degrades, as well as in what fortifies
and exalts. At its worst their love has something divine about it, but
often it seems a divine orgy rather than a divine inspiration. Not
seldom does it lead to madness and ignominy. That Antony loses the
world for it is a small matter and even proves his grandeur of soul.
But for it, besides “offending reputation,” he profanes his inward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
honour as well; and that unmasks it as the Siren and Fury of their
lives. Indeed, such love is self-destructive, and for it the lovers
sacrifice the means of securing it against the hostile power of things.
Yet, just because it is so plenary and permeating, it becomes an
inspiration too. When its prodigal largesse fails, at the hour when it
is stripped of its inessential charms, the lovers are thrown back on
itself; and at once it elevates them both. Antony, believing Cleopatra
dead, and not yet undeceived as to the part that he fancies she played
at the last, thinks only of following her to entreat and obtain a
reconciliation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When he learns that she still lives, no reproach
crosses his lips for the deceit; his only wish as the blood flows
from his breast is to be borne “where Cleopatra bides” to take a last
farewell. He wrestles with death till he receives the final embrace:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I am dying, Egypt, dying: only</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I here importune death awhile, until</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of many thousand kisses the poor last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I lay upon thy lips.</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xv. 18.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thereafter he has no thought of himself but
only of her, counselling her in complete self-abnegation to seek of
Caesar her honour with her safety, and recommending her to trust only
Proculeius—one who, as we soon learn, would be eager to preserve her life.</p>

<p>And her love, too, though perhaps more fitfully, yet all the more
strikingly, is deepened and solemnised by trial. After Actium it quite
loses its element of mockery and petulance. Her flout at Antony’s
negligence before the battle is the last we hear her utter. Henceforth,
whether she protests her faith, or speeds him to the fight, or welcomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
him on his return, her words have a new seriousness and weight.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
Her feeling seems to become simpler and sincerer as her fortunes cloud, and
at her lover’s death it is nature alone that triumphs. In the first
shock of bereavement Iras, attempting consolation, addresses her as
“Royal Egypt, Empress”; and she replies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No more, but e’en a woman, and commanded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By such poor passion as the maid that milks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And does the meanest chares.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xv. 72.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Her grief for her great loss, a grief, perhaps,
hardly anticipated by herself, is in her own eyes her teacher, and
“begins to make a better life.” Even now she may falter, if the usual
interpretation of her fraud with the treasure is correct. Even now, at
all events, she has to be urged by the natural and royal but not quite
unimpeachable motive, the dread of external disgrace. Cleopatra is very
human to the last. Her weaknesses do not disappear, but they are but as
fuel to the flames of her love by which they are bred and which they
help to feed. It is still as the “curled Antony” she pictures her dead
lover, and it is in “crown and robe” that she will receive that kiss
which it is her heaven to have. But even in this there is a striking
similarity to Antony’s expectation of the land where “souls do couch
on flowers,” and where they will be the cynosure of the gazing ghosts.
Their oneness of heart and feeling is indeed now complete, and their
love is transfigured. It is at his call she comes, and his name is
the last word she utters, before she lays the second asp on her arm.
The most wonderful touch of all is that now she feels her right to be
considered his wife. This, of course, is due to Shakespeare, but it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span>
not altogether new. It occurs in Daniel’s tragedy, when she calls on
Antony’s spirit to pray the gods on her behalf:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O if in life we could not severd be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall death divide our bodies now asunder?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must thine in Egypt, mine in Italy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be kept the Monuments of Fortune’s wonder?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If any powres be there whereas thou art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Sith our country gods betray our case),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O worke they may their gracious helpe impart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To save thy wofull <i>wife</i> from such disgrace.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It also occurs twice in Plutarch, from whom Daniel
probably obtained it. In the <i>Comparison of Demetrius and Marcus
Antonius</i>, he writes:<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot">Antonius first of all married two wives together,
the which never Romane durst doe before, but him self.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In the biography, when Cleopatra has lifted him to
the Monument, we are told:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Then she dryed up his blood that had berayed
his face, and called him her Lord, <i>her husband</i>, and Emperour,
forgetting her owne miserie and calamity for the pitie and compassion
she tooke of him.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is not, therefore, the invention of the
idea, but the new position in which he introduces it, that shows
Shakespeare’s genius. It has no great significance, either in Plutarch
or Daniel. In the one, Cleopatra is speaking in compassion of Antony;
in the other, she is bespeaking Antony’s compassion for herself. But in
Shakespeare, when she scorns life for her love, and prefers honour with
the aspic’s bite to safety with shame, she feels that now at last their
union has the highest sanction, and that all the dross of her nature is
purged away from the pure spirit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Husband, I come:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now to that name my courage prove my title!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am fire and air: my other elements</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I give to baser life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 290.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
Truly their love, which at first seemed to justify Aristophanes against
Diotima, just because it is true love, turns out to answer Diotima’s
description after all. Or perhaps it rather suggests the conclusion in
the <i>Phaedrus</i>: “I have shown this of all inspirations to be the
noblest and the highest, and the offspring of the highest; and that he
who loves the beautiful, is called a lover, because he partakes of it.”
Antony and Cleopatra, with all their errors, are lovers and partake of
beauty, which we cannot say of the arid respectability of Octavius. It
is well and right that they should perish as they do: but so perishing
they have made their full atonement; and we can rejoice that they have
at once triumphed over their victor, and left our admiration for them free.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">POSITION OF THE PLAY BEFORE THE ROMANCES.<br />
ITS POLITICAL AND ARTISTIC ASPECTS</span></h3>
</div>

<p><i>Coriolanus</i> seems to have been first published in the folio
of 1623, and is one of the sixteen plays described as not formerly
“entered to other men.” In this dearth of information there has
naturally been some debate on the date of its composition, yet the
opinions of critics with few exceptions agree as to its general
position and tend more and more to limit the period of uncertainty to a
very few months.</p>

<p>This comparative unanimity is due to the evidence of style,
versification, and treatment rather than of reminiscences and
allusions. Though a fair number of the latter have been discovered
or invented, some of them are vague and doubtful, some inapposite or
untenable, hardly any are of value from their inherent likelihood.</p>

<p>Of these, one which has been considered to give the <i>terminus a
quo</i> in dating the play was pointed out by Malone in the fable of
Menenius. Plutarch’s account is somewhat bald:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">On a time all the members of mans bodie, dyd
rebell against the bellie, complaining of it, that it only remained in
the middest of the bodie, without doing any thing, neither dyd beare
any labour to the maintenaunce of the rest: whereas all other partes
and members dyd labour paynefully, and was very carefull to satisfie
the appetites and desiers of the bodie. And so the bellie, all this
notwithstanding, laughed at their follie, and sayed: “It is true, I
first receyve all meates that norishe mans bodie: but afterwardes I
send it againe to the norishement of other partes of the same. Even so
(quoth he) O you, my masters, and cittizens of Rome: the reason is a
like betwene the Senate, and you. For matters being well digested, and
their counsells throughly examined, touching the benefit of the common
wealth; the Senatours are cause of the common commoditie that commeth
unto every one of you.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">This is meagre compared with Shakespeare’s
full-blooded and dramatic narrative, and though in any case the chief
credit for the transformation would be due to the poet, who certainly
contributes most of the picturesque and humorous details and all of
the interruptions and rejoinders, it has been thought that he owes
something to the expanded version in Camden’s <i>Remaines concerning
Britaine</i>, which appeared in 1605.</p>

<p class="blockquot">All the members of the body conspired against the
stomacke, as against the swallowing gulfe of all their labors; for
whereas the eies beheld, the eares heard, the handes labored, the feete
traveled, the tongue spake, and all partes performed their functions,
onely the stomacke lay idle and consumed all. Here uppon they ioyntly
agreed al to forbeare their labors, and to pine away their lasie and
publike enemy. One day passed over, the second followed very tedious,
but the third day was so grievous to them all, that they called a
common Counsel; the eyes waxed dimme, the feete could not support the
bodie, the armes waxed lasie, the tongue faltered, and could not lay
open the matter; therefore they all with one accord desired the advise
of the Heart. Then Reason layd open before them that hee against whome
they had proclaimed warres, was the cause of all this their misery:
For he as their common steward, when his allowances were withdrawne of
necessitie withdrew theirs fro them, as not receiving that he might
allow. Therefore it were a farre better course to supply him, than that
the limbs should faint with hunger. So by the perswasion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
Reason, the stomacke was served, the limbes comforted, and peace
re-established. Even so it fareth with the bodies of Common weale; for
albeit the Princes gather much, yet not so much for themselves, as for
others: So that if they want, they cannot supply the want of others;
therefore do not repine at Princes heerein, but respect the common good
of the whole publike estate.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It has been pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
in criticism of Malone’s suggestion, that in some respects
Shakespeare’s version agrees with Plutarch’s and disagrees with
Camden’s. Thus in Camden it is the stomach and not the belly that is
denounced, the members do not confine themselves to words but proceed
to deeds, it is not the belly but Reason from its seat in the heart
that sets forth the moral. This is quite true, but no one doubted that
Shakespeare got from Plutarch his general scheme; the only question is
whether he fitted into it details from another source. It has also been
objected that Shakespeare was quite capable of making the additions
for himself; and this also is quite true as the other and more vivid
additions prove, if it needed to be proved. Nevertheless, when we
find Shakespeare’s expansions in the play following some of the lines
laid down by Camden in the <i>Remaines</i>, occasionally with verbal
coincidence, it seems not unlikely that the <i>Remaines</i> were known
to him. Thus he does not treat the members like Plutarch in the mass,
but like Camden enumerates them and their functions; the stomach in
Camden like the belly in Shakespeare is called a gulf, a term that is
very appropriate but that would not occur to everyone; the heart where
Reason dwells and to which Camden’s mutineers appeal for advice, is the
counsellor heart in Shakespeare’s list.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
Moreover, it has been shown by Mr. Sidney Lee that there were friendly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
relations between the two men. So it is a conjecture no less probable
than pleasing that Shakespeare owed a few hints to the great and
patriotic scholar whom Ben Jonson hailed as “most reverend head.”</p>

<p>It is clear, however, that if the debt to Camden was more certain than
it is, this would only give us the year before which <i>Coriolanus</i>
could not have been written, and it would not of itself establish a
date shortly after the publication of the <i>Remaines</i>. Such a date
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
has been suggested, but the reference to Camden has been made merely
auxiliary to the argument of a connection between the play and the
general circumstances of the time. This surmise, for it can hardly be
called more, will presently be noticed, and meanwhile it may be said
that the internal evidence is all against it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an excessively late date has been proposed for
<i>Coriolanus</i> on the ground of its alleged indebtedness to the
fourth edition of North, of which it is sometimes maintained that
Shakespeare possessed a copy. Till 1612, Volumnia says in her great appeal:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Think now with thy selfe, how much more
<i>unfortunatly</i>, then all the women livinge we are come hether;</p>

<p class="no-indent">but in the fourth edition this becomes
<i>unfortunate</i>, and so Shakespeare has it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Think with thyself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How more unfortunate than all living women</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are we come hither.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 96.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the employment of the adjectival for the
adverbial form is a very insignificant change, and is, besides,
suggested by the rhythm. Moreover, such importance as it might have, is
neutralised by a counter argument on similar lines, which would go to
prove that one of the first two editions was used. In them Coriolanus
tells Aufidius:</p>

<p class="blockquot">If I had feared death, I would not have come
hither to have put my life in hazard: but prickt forward with
<i>spite</i> and desire I have to be revenged of them that thus have
banished me, etc.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In 1603, this suffers the curtailment, “pricked
forward with desire to be revenged, etc.” But Shakespeare says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent29">If</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I had fear’d death, of all men i’ the world</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would have ’voided thee, but in mere <i>spite</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To be full quit of those my banishers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand I before thee here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> v. 86.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
This argument is no doubt of the same precarious kind as the other;
still in degree it is stronger, for the persistence of <i>spite</i> is
much more distinctive than the disappearance of a suffix.</p>

<p>In any case this verbal detail is a very narrow foundation to build
a theory upon, which there is nothing else to support, except one
of those alluring and hazardous guesses that would account for the
play in the conditions of the time. This, too, as in the previous
case, may be reserved for future discussion. Meanwhile the dating
of <i>Coriolanus</i>, subsequently to 1612, is not only opposed to
internal evidences of versification and style, but would separate it
from Shakespeare’s tragedies and introduce it among the romantic plays
of his final period.</p>

<p>If, however, we turn to the supposed allusions that make for the
intermediate date of 1608 or 1609, we do not find them much more
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Thus it has been argued that the severe cold in January, 1608, when
even the Thames was frozen over, furnished the simile:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">You are no surer, no,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than is the coal of fire upon the ice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 176.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But surely there must have been many opportunities
for such things to present themselves to Shakespeare’s observation or
imagination, by the time that he was forty-four years old.</p>

<p>Again Malone found a reference to James’s proclamation in favour of
breeding silk-worms and the importation of young mulberry trees during
1609, in the expression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now humble as the ripest mulberry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That will not hold the handling.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 79.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But even in <i>Venus and Adonis</i> Shakespeare
had told how, in admiration of the youth’s beauty, the birds</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries; (1103.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
and in <i>Midsummer-Night’s Dream</i>, Titania orders the fairies to
feed Bottom</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<i>III.</i> i. 170.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A third of these surmises is even more gratuitous. Chalmers calls
attention to the repeated references in the play to famine and dearth,
and supposes they were suggested by the scarcity which prevailed in
England during the years 1608 and 1609. But the lack of corn among the
people is one of the presuppositions of the story, to which Plutarch
also recurs.</p>

<p>There is only one allusion that has strength to stand by itself,
though even it is doubtful; and it belongs to a different class, for,
if authentic, it is suggested not to Shakespeare by contemporary
events, but to a contemporary writer by Shakespeare. Malone noticed the
coincidence between the line, “He lurch’d all swords of the garland”
(<span class="smcap">ii.</span> ii. 105), and a remark in <i>Epicoene</i>:
“You have lurched your friends of the better half of the garland”
(<span class="allsmcap">v.</span> i.); and considered that here, as
not infrequently, Ben Jonson was girding at Shakespeare. Afterwards he
withdrew his conjecture because he found a similar expression in one
of Nashe’s pamphlets, and concluded that it was proverbial; but it has
been pointed out in answer to this<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
that Nashe has only the <i>lurch</i> and not the supplementary words,
<i>of the garland</i>, while it is to the phrase as a whole, not to the
component parts, that the individual character belongs. This, if not
absolutely beyond challenge, is at least very cogent, and probably few
will deny that <i>Coriolanus</i> must have been in existence before
<i>Epicoene</i> was acted in January 1609, old style.</p>

<p>How long before? And did it succeed or precede <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
Attempts have been made to find in that play immediate anticipations
of the mental attitude and of particular thoughts that appear in
<i>Coriolanus</i>. Thus Octavia’s dilemma in her petition has been
quoted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">A more unhappy lady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If this division chance, ne’er stood between,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Praying for both parts:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The good gods will mock me presently,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I shall pray, “O, bless my lord and husband!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“O, bless my brother!” Husband win, win brother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twixt these extremes at all.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iv. 12.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And this has been taken as a link with Volumnia’s
perplexity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">And to poor we</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thine enmity’s most capital: thou barr’st us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That all but we enjoy: for how can we,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas, how can we for our country pray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our comfort in the country. We must find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An evident calamity, though we had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our wish, which side should win.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 103.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But then the same sort of conflict puzzles the
Lady Blanch in <i>King John</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Which is the side that I must go withal?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am with both: each army hath a hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in their rage, I having hold of both,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They whirl asunder and dismember me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assured loss before the match be play’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 327.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Could not this style of argument be used to prove
that <i>Coriolanus</i> and <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> immediately
followed <i>King John</i>?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span></p>

<p>Or again the contemptuous descriptions of the people by Octavius,
Cleopatra and Antony himself have been treated as preludes to the more
savage vituperations in <i>Coriolanus</i>. But <i>Julius Caesar</i>
gives an equally unflattering account of mob law, and some of Casca’s
gibes would quite fit the mouth of Coriolanus or Menenius. On these
lines we should be as much entitled to make this play the direct
successor of the first as of the second of its companions, a theory
that would meet with scant acceptance. The truth is that whenever
Shakespeare deals with the populace, he finds some one to disparage it
in the mass.</p>

<p>Still there is little doubt that <i>Coriolanus</i> does occupy the
position these arguments would assign to it, but the real evidence
is of another kind. To begin with there is what Coleridge describes
in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> as the “happy valiancy of style,”
which first becomes marked in that play, which is continued in this,
and which henceforth in a greater or less degree characterises all
Shakespeare’s work. Then even more conclusive are the peculiarities
of metre, and especially the increase in the total of weak and light
endings together with the decrease of the light by themselves. Finally,
there is the conduct of the story to a conclusion that proposes
no enigma and inflicts no pang, but even more than in the case of
<i>Macbeth</i> satisfies, and even more than in the case of <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> uplifts the heart, without troublesome questionings
on the part of the reader. “As we close the book,” says Mr. Bradley,
“we feel more as we do at the close of <i>Cymbeline</i> than as we do
at the close of <i>Othello</i>.” We cannot be far wrong in placing it
in the last months of 1608 or the first months of 1609.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to find suggestions of a personal kind for
Shakespeare’s choice of the subject. The extreme ease with which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>
have been discovered for the various dates proposed may well teach us
caution. Thus Professor Brandl who assigns it an earlier position than
most critics and discusses it before <i>Lear</i> sees in it the outcome
of events that occurred in the first years of the century.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The material for <i>Coriolanus</i> was perhaps put
in Shakespeare’s way by a contemporary tragedy which keenly excited
the Londoners, and especially the courtly and literary circles, about
1603 and 1604. Sir Walter Raleigh had been one of the most splendid
gentlemen at the court of Elizabeth, was a friend of Spenser and Ben
Jonson, had himself tried his hand at lyric poetry, and in addition
as adventurous officer had discovered Virginia and annexed Guiana.
He was the most highly considered but also the best hated man in
England: for his behaviour was domineering, in the consciousness of
his innate efficiency he showed without disguise his contempt for the
multitude, the farm of wine-licenses granted him by the Queen had made
him objectionable to the pothouse politicians, and his opposition in
parliament to a bill for cheapening corn had recently drawn on him
new unpopularity. He, therefore, shortly after the accession of James
succumbed to the charge, that he, the scarred veteran of the Spanish
wars, the zealous advocate of new expeditions against Spain, had
involved himself in treasonous transactions with this, the hereditary
foe of England. In November 1603 the man who had won treasure-fleets
and vast regions for his country, almost fell a victim to popular rage
as he was being transferred from one prison to another.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
A month later he was condemned to death on wretched evidence: he was
not yet executed however but locked up in the Tower, so that men were
in suspense as to his fate for many years. To depict his character his
biographer Edwards involuntarily hit on some lines of Shakespeare’s
<i>Coriolanus</i>. The figure of the Roman, who had deserved well but
incurred hatred, of the patriot whom his aristocratic convictions
drive to the enemy, was already familiar to the dramatist from North’s
translation of Plutarch; and Camden’s <i>Remaines concerning
Britaine</i>, which had newly appeared in 1605 contributed a more
detailed version of the fable of the belly and the members, first set
forth by Livy. From this mood and about this time <i>Coriolanus</i>,
for the dating of which only the very relative evidence of metre and
style is available, may most probably have proceeded.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
In this passage, Professor Brandl has brought out some of the
considerations that would lend the case of Raleigh a peculiar interest
in the eyes of men like Shakespeare, and has made the most of the
parallels between his story and the story of Coriolanus.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
It is necessary of course to look away from almost all the points except
those enumerated, for when we remember Sir Walter’s robust adulation
of Elizabeth, and tortuous policy at court, it is difficult to pair
him with the Roman who “would not flatter Neptune for his trident,”
and of whom it was said, “his heart’s his mouth.” Still the analogies
in career and character are there, so far as they go; but they are
insufficient to prove that the actual suggested the poetical tragedy,
still less to override the internal evidence, relative though that
be; for they could linger and germinate in the poet’s mind to bring
forth fruit long afterwards: as for example the treason and execution
of Biron in 1602 inspired Chapman to write <i>The Conspiracie</i> and
<i>The Tragedie</i> which were acted in 1608.</p>

<p>Again, in connection with what seems to be the actual date, an attempt
has been made to explain one prominent characteristic of the play
from a domestic experience through which Shakespeare had just passed.
His mother died in September 1608, and her memory is supposed to be
enshrined in the picture of Volumnia. As Dr. Brandes puts it:<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot">The death of a mother is always a mournfully
irreparable loss, often the saddest a man can sustain. We can realise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
how deeply it would go to Shakespeare’s heart when we remember
the capacity for profound and passionate feeling with which
nature had blessed and cursed him. We know little of his
mother; but judging from that affinity which generally
exists between famous sons and their mothers, we may suppose
she was no ordinary woman. Mary Arden, who belonged to
an old and honourable family, which traced its descent
(perhaps justly) back to the days of Edward the Confessor,
represented the haughty patrician element in the Shakespeare
family. Her ancestors had borne their coat of arms for
centuries, and the son would be proud of his mother for this
among other reasons, just as the mother would be proud of
her son. In the midst of the prevailing gloom and bitterness
of his spirits,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
this fresh blow fell upon him, and out of his weariness of life as
his surroundings and experiences showed it to him, recalled this one
mainstay to him—his mother. He remembered all she had been to him for
forty-four years, and the thoughts of the man and the dreams of the
poet were thus led to dwell upon the significance in a man’s life of
this unique form, comparable to no other—his mother. Thus it was that,
although his genius must follow the path it had entered upon and pursue
it to the end, we find, in the midst of all that was low and base in
his next work, this one sublime mother-form, the proudest and most
highly-wrought that he has drawn, Volumnia.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Thus Shakespeare, in a mood of pessimism, and in
the desolation of bereavement, turned to a subject that he treated on
its seamy side, but redeemed from its meanness by exalting the idea
of the mother in obedience to his own pious regrets. Even, however,
if we grant the assumptions in regard to Mary Arden’s pedigree and
her aristocratic family pride, and the unique support she gave to her
son, does this statement give a true account of the impression the
play produces? Is it the fact that, apart from the figure of Volumnia,
the story is “low and base,” and is it not rather the record of grand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span>
though perverted heroism? Is it the fact that Volumnia stands out as a
study of motherhood, such as the first heartache at a mother’s death
would inspire? The most sympathetic traits in her portrait are drawn
by Plutarch. Shakespeare’s many touches supply the harshness, the
ambition, the prejudice. If these additions are due to Shakespeare’s
wistful broodings on his own mother, a woman with a son of genius may
well hope that he will never brood on her.</p>

<p>Then, especially by those who advocate a later date for the play, a
political motive for it has been discovered. Mr. Whitelaw, who would
assign it to 1610, when James’s first parliament was dissolved,
conjectures that “in <i>Coriolanus</i> Shakespeare intended a two-fold
warning, to the pride of James, and to the gathering resistance of
the Commons.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Mr. Garnett,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
on the other hand, maintains that “Coriolanus, to our apprehension,
manifestly reflects the feelings of a conservative observer of the
contests between James and his refractory parliaments,” and placing
it after the <i>Tempest</i>, would connect it with the dissolution
of the Addled Parliament in 1614. But since the friction between
King and Commons, though it intensified with the years, was seldom
entirely absent, this theory adapts itself pretty well to any date,
and Dr. Brandes, while refusing to trace the spirit of the play to
any “momentary political situation,” adopts the general principle as
quite compatible with the state of affairs in 1608. He puts the case as
follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Was it Shakespeare’s intention to allude to the
strained relations existing between James and his parliament? Does
Coriolanus represent an aristocratically-minded poet’s side-glance at
the political situation in England? I fancy it does. Heaven knows there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
was little resemblance between the amazingly craven and vacillating
James and the haughty, resolute hero of Roman tradition, who fought a
whole garrison single-handed. Nor was it personal resemblance which
suggested the comparison, but a general conception of the situation
as between a beneficent power on the one hand, and the people on the
other. He regarded the latter wholly as mob, and looked upon their
struggle for freedom as mutiny, pure and simple.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This theory, however, in all its varieties seems
to attribute too definite an influence to the controversies of the
hour, and to turn Shakespeare too much into the politician prepense.
Certainly <i>Coriolanus</i> is not meant to be a constitutional
manifesto; probably it does not, even at unawares, idealise a
contemporary dispute; it is hardly likely that Shakespeare so much
as intrudes conscious allusions to the questions then at issue. And
this on account not only of the particular opinions attributed to him,
but, much more, of his usual practice in poetic creation. Do any of
these alleged incentives in the circumstances, public or private, of
his life go far to explain his attraction to a story and selection of
it, its power over him and his power over it? Doubtless in realising
the subject that took his fancy, he would draw on the stores of his
experience as well as his imagination. In dealing with the tragedy of
a proud and unpopular hero of antiquity, very possibly he would be
helped by what he knew of the tragedy of a proud and unpopular worthy
of his own time. In dealing with the influence of a mother and the
reverence of a son, very probably the memories of his own home would
hover before his mind. In dealing with the plebeians and patricians of
Rome, he would inevitably fill in the details from his knowledge of the
burgesses and nobles of England, and he might get hints for his picture
of the bygone struggle, from the struggle that he himself could watch.
But it is the story of Coriolanus that comes first and that absorbs all
such material into itself, just as the seed in its growth assimilates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
nourishment from the earth and sunshine and rain. These things are not
the seed. The experiences are utilised in the interest of the play; the
play is not utilised in the interest of the experiences.</p>

<p>It is particularly important to emphasise this in view of the
circumstance that <i>Coriolanus</i> has often been regarded as a drama
of principles rather than of character, even by those who refrain
from reading into it any particular reference. But Shakespeare’s
supreme preoccupation is always with his fable, which explains, and is
explained by, human nature in action. He does not set out to commend or
censure or examine a precept or a theory or a doctrine. Of course the
life of men is concerned with such matters, and he could not exclude
them without being untrue to his aim. Thus, to take the most obvious
example, it is impossible to treat of character with a total omission
of ethical considerations, since character is connected with conduct,
and conduct has its ethical aspect; and, indeed, success in getting to
the truth of character depends very much on the keenness of the moral
insight. It is very largely Shakespeare’s moral insight that gives him
his unrivalled position among the interpreters of men; and we may, if
we like, derive any number of improving lessons from his works. But he
is an artist, not a moralist; and he wrote for the story, not for the
moral. Just in the same way an architect seeks to design a beautiful or
convenient building, not to illustrate mechanical laws. Nevertheless,
in proportion as these are neglected, the building will not rise
or will not last; and if they are obeyed, however unconsciously,
the illustration of them will be provided. In Charlotte Brontë’s
<i>Shirley</i>, when Caroline gives Robert Moore this very play to
read, he asks, “Is it to operate like a sermon?” And she answers: “It
is to stir you; to give you new sensations. <i>It is to make you feel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
life strongly</i>”—(that is the main thing, and then comes the indirect
consequence)—“not only your virtues but your vicious perverse points.”</p>

<p>Now just as in all Shakespeare’s dramas, though or rather because they
are personal, the ethical considerations cannot be excluded; so in a
drama that moves through a constitutional crisis, though or rather
because it, too, is personal, political considerations cannot be
excluded. They are there, though it is on the second plane. And just
as his general delineation of character would be unsatisfactory if
his moral insight were at fault, so his delineation of the characters
that play their part in this history would be unsatisfactory if his
political insight were at fault. He is not necessarily bound to
appreciate correctly the conditions that prevailed in reality or by
report: that is required only for historical accuracy or fidelity to
tradition. But he is bound to appreciate the conditions as he imagines
them, and not to violate in his treatment of them the principles that
underlie all political society.</p>

<p>Yet this he has been accused of doing. He has been charged with a
hatred of the people that is incompatible even with a benevolent
tyranny, and with a glorification of the protagonist’s ruthless
disregard of popular claims. Thus Dr. Brandes, in the greater part
of a chapter, dwells upon Shakespeare’s “physical aversion for the
atmosphere of the people,” and “the absence of any humane consideration
for the oppressed condition of the poor”; and, on the other hand,
upon his “hero-worship” for Marcius, whom he glorifies as a demi-god.
Though admitting the dramatist’s detestation of the crime of treason,
this critic sees no implicit censure of what preceded it. To him
Shakespeare’s impression of life as conveyed in the play is that “there
must of necessity be formed round the solitary great ones of the earth,
a conspiracy of envy and hatred raised by the small and mean.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span></p>

<p>It is no doubt true that this and many other Shakespearian plays
abound in hostile or scornful vituperation of the people; and not only
of their moral and mental demerits; their sweaty clothes, their rank
breaths, their grossness and uncleanness are held up to derision and
execration. But are we to attribute these sentiments to Shakespeare?
Such utterances are <i>ex hypothesi</i> dramatic, and show us merely
the attitude of the speakers, who are without exception men of the
opposite camp or unfriendly critics. Only once does Shakespeare
give his personal, or rather, impersonal estimate. It is in the
<i>Induction</i> to the second part of <i>Henry IV.</i>, when Rumour,
whose words, in this respect at least, cannot be influenced by
individual bias, speaks of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">the blunt monster of uncounted heads,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The still-discordant, wavering multitude.&emsp;(line 18.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">That is, the populace as a whole is stupid,
disunited, fickle. And this is how, apart from the exaggerations of
their opponents, Shakespeare invariably treats crowds of citizens,
whether in the ancient or modern world. He therefore with perfect
consistency regards them as quite unfit for rule, and when they have
it or aspire to it, they cover themselves with ridicule or involve
themselves in crime. But this is by no means to hate them. On the
contrary he is kindly enough to individual representatives, and he
certainly believes in the sacred obligation of governing them for their
good. Where then are the governors to be found? Shakespeare answers:
in the royal and aristocratic classes. It is the privilege and duty
of those born in high position to conduct the whole community aright.
Shakespeare can do justice to the Venetian oligarchy and the English
monarchy. But while to him the rule of the populace is impossible, he
also recognises that nobles and kings may be unequal to their task. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
majority of his kings indeed are more or less failures; his nobles—and
in this play, the patricians—often cut a rather sorry figure. In short,
popular government must be wrong, but royal or aristocratic government
need not be right.</p>

<p>And this was exactly what historical experience at the time seemed to
prove. The Jacqueries, the Peasants’ Wars, the Wat Tyler or Jack Cade
Insurrections, were not calculated to commend democratic experiments;
and, on the other hand, the authority of king and nobles had often,
though not always, secured the welfare of the state.</p>

<p>Now, holding these opinions, would Shakespeare be likely to glorify
Coriolanus? Of course, in a sense he does. There is a <i>Lues
Boswelliana</i> to which the dramatist like the biographer should and
must succumb. He must have a fellow-feeling for his hero and understand
from within all that can be urged on his behalf. So Shakespeare
glorifies Coriolanus in the same way that he glorifies Hamlet or Brutus
or Antony. That is, he appreciates their greatness and explains their
offences so that we sympathise with them and do not regard them as
unaccountable aberrations; but offences they remain and they are not
extenuated. On the contrary they receive all due prominence and are
shown to bring about the tragic catastrophe. This is even more the case
with Coriolanus than with some of the others. So much stress is laid on
his violence and asperities that to many he is antipathetic, and the
antipathy is reflected on the cause that he champions. Gervinus says
very truly:</p>

<p class="blockquot">It will be allowed that from the example of Brutus
many more would be won over to the cause of the people, than would be
won over to aristocratic principles by Coriolanus.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Quite apart from the final apostasy he strikes the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
unprejudiced reader as an example to eschew rather than to imitate.
Charlotte Brontë, not a Shakespearian scholar but a woman of no less
common sense than genius, gives the natural interpretation of his
career in the passage I have already referred to. After Caroline and
Moore have finished the play, she makes the former ask concerning the hero:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Was he not faulty as well as great?”</p>
<p>Moore nodded.</p>
<p>“And what was his fault?&emsp;What made him hated by the citizens?
What caused him to be banished by his countrymen?”</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">She answers her own question by quoting Aufidius’
estimate, and proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“And you must not be proud to your work people;
you must not neglect the chance of soothing them; and you must not be
of an inflexible nature, uttering a request as austerely as if it were
a command.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">That, so far as it goes, is a quite legitimate
“moral” to draw from the story; and it is the obvious one.</p>

<p>How then does Shakespeare conceive the political situation? On the
one side there is a despised and famished populace, driven by its
misery to demand powers in the state that it cannot wisely use, and
trusting to leaders that are worse than itself. On the other side
there is a prejudiced aristocracy, numbering competent men in its
ranks, but disorganised and, to some extent, demoralised by plebeian
encroachments, so that it can no longer act with its old efficiency
and consistency. And there is one great aristocrat, pre-eminently
consistent and efficient, but whose greatness becomes mischievous
to himself and others, partly because it is out of harmony with the
times, partly because it is corrupted by his inordinate pride. And
to all these persons, or groups of persons, Shakespeare’s attitude,
as we shall see, is at once critical and sympathetic. Admitting the
conditions, we can only agree with Coleridge’s verdict: “This play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
illustrates the wonderfully philosophic impartiality of Shakespeare’s
politics.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
And there is no reason why the conditions should not be admitted.
It is easy to imagine a society in which the masses are not yet
ripe for self-government, and in which the classes are no longer
able to steer the state, while a gifted and bigoted champion of
tradition only makes matters worse. Indeed, something similar has been
exemplified in history oftener than once or twice. Whether in point
of fact Shakespeare’s conception is correct for the particular set of
circumstances he describes is quite another question, that concerns
neither the excellence of <i>Coriolanus</i> as a drama nor the fairness
of its political views, but solely its fidelity to antiquarian truth
and the accuracy of its antiquarian <i>data</i>.”</p>

<p>Clearly it was impossible for Shakespeare to revive the spirit of the
times in <i>Coriolanus</i>, even to the extent that he had done so in
<i>Julius Caesar</i> or <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, for the simple
reason that in them, with whatever trespasses into fiction on the
part of himself or his authority, he was following the record of what
had actually taken place, while now he was dealing with a legend that
seems to have the less foundation in fact the more it is examined. The
tribunate, with the establishment of which the whole action begins, the
opposition to which by Marcius is his main offence, and the occupants
of which play so important a part in the proceedings, is now generally
held to be of much later origin than the supposed date of the story.
There is no agreement as to the names of the chief persons; Coriolanus
is Cneius or Caius, his mother is Veturia or Volumnia, his wife is
Volumnia or Vergilia, the Volscian leader Tullus Aufidius or Amfidius
or Attius Tullius. Even the appellation Coriolanus rouses suspicion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
for the bestowal of such titles seems to have been unknown till long
afterwards, and, in the view of some, points not to conquest but to
origin; and there are contradictory accounts of the hero’s end. It
has been conjectured<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
that the whole story arose in connection with religious observances and
contains a large mythological admixture; and we may remember how at
the end it is associated with the erection of the temple to <i>Fortuna
Muliebris</i>.</p>

<p>This much at least is beyond doubt, that the account given by Plutarch,
from whom Shakespeare took his material, and even by Livy, whom he may
have read, has much less matter-of-fact reality than characterises the
later Roman lives. There are many discrepancies and contradictions,
especially in Plutarch’s description. Now he gives what we may consider
an idealised picture of the plebs, attributing to it extraordinary
self-control and sagacity, and again it is to him merely the rascal
vulgar. Now he seems to approve the pliancy which the Senate showed on
the advice of the older and wiser men, and again he seems to blame it
as undignified. And the mixture of bravado and pusillanimity during
the siege is almost unintelligible. Now the city sends the humblest
embassages to the rebel, now it haughtily refuses to treat till he has
withdrawn from Roman soil, and again it despatches what North calls “a
goodly rabble of superstition and priestes” with new supplications.</p>

<p>From a narrative that teemed with incongruities like the above,
Shakespeare was entitled to select the alternatives that would combine
to a harmonious whole, and he rightly chose those that were nearest
to his own comprehension and experience, though perhaps in doing so
he failed to make the most of such elements of historic truth as the
tradition may contain, and certainly effaced some of the antique colouring.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span></p>

<p>But if Plutarch’s <i>Coriolanus</i> has less foundation in fact than
some of the later Lives, it is not without compensating advantages. The
circumstance that it is in so large measure a legend, implies that the
popular imagination has been busy working it up, and it already falls
into great scenic crises which lend themselves of their own accord
to the dramatist’s art. It is rather remarkable in view of this that
it had received so little attention from the tragedians of the time.
Perhaps its two-fold remoteness, from worldwide historical issues on
the one hand, and from specifically romantic feeling on the other,
may have told against it. The stories of Lucretia and Virginia had as
primitive and circumscribed a setting, and were nevertheless popular
enough: but they have an emotional interest that appeals to the general
taste. The story of Julius Caesar lacks the sentimental lure, but
concerns such mighty issues that it was the best beloved of all. And
next comes the story of Antony and Cleopatra, which in a high degree
unites both attractions. But <i>Coriolanus</i>, even as treated by
Shakespeare, is unsympathetic to many, and the legend is of so little
historic significance that it is often omitted from modern handbooks of
Roman history; so, for these reasons, despite its pre-eminent fitness
for the stage, it was generally passed over.</p>

<p>Not universally, however. It seems already to have engaged the
attention of one important dramatist in France, the prolific and gifted
Alexandre Hardy. Hardy began to publish his works only in 1623, and the
volume containing his <i>Coriolan</i> appeared only in 1625; so there
is hardly any possibility of Shakespeare’s having utilised this play.
And, on the other hand, it was certainly written before 1608, probably
in the last years of the sixteenth century, but in any case by 1607, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
there is even less possibility of its being influenced by Shakespeare’s
treatment. All the more interesting is it to observe the coincidences
that exist between them, and that are due to their having selected a
great many of the same <i>motifs</i> from Plutarch’s story. It shows
that in that story Plutarch met the playwright half way, and justifies
the statement of Hardy in his argument that “few subjects are to be
found in Roman history which are worthier of the stage.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
The number of subsequent French dramas with Coriolanus as hero proves
that he was right, though in England, as so frequently, Shakespeare’s
name put a veto on new experiments.</p>

<p>Hardy’s tragedy in style and structure follows the Senecan manner of
Jodelle and Garnier, but he compromised with mediaeval fashions in so
far as to adopt the peculiar modification of the “simultaneous” or
“complex” decoration which is usual in his other plays. In accordance
with that, several scenes were presented at the same time on the stage,
and actors made their first speeches from the area appropriated to
that one of them which the particular phase of the action required.
There was thus considerable latitude in regard to the unity of place,
and even more in regard to the unity of time; but the freedom was
not so great as in the Elizabethan theatre, for after all there was
space only for a limited number of scenes, or “mansions” as they
would formerly have been called. Generally there were five, two at
each side and one at the back. In the <i>Coriolan</i> there were six,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>
and there is as well a seventh place indicated in the play without
scenical decoration.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
Even so they are few, compared with the two and
twenty<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
that Shakespeare employs; and though no doubt that number might be
considerably reduced without injury to the effect, by running together
localities that approximate in character and position, one street with
another street, the forum with a public place and the like, still it
would in any case exceed what Hardy allows himself. This may account
for some of his omissions as compared with Shakespeare.</p>

<p>His scenarium includes the house of Coriolanus and the forum at Rome,
the house of Coriolanus and the house of Amfidius at Antium, the
Volscian camp near Rome, the council-hall at Antium, and in addition
to these an indeterminate spot where Coriolanus soliloquises after his
expulsion.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
There is no room for Corioli, and this may be why Hardy begins somewhat
later than Shakespeare with the collision between the hero and the
people, and gets as far as the banishment by the end of the first act.
In the second, Marcius leaves Rome, presents himself to Amfidius, and
obtains the leadership of the Volscians. The third portrays the panic
of the Romans and the reception of their embassage by Coriolanus.
In the fourth, the Roman ladies make ready to accompany Volumnia on
her mission, Amfidius schemes to use all Coriolanus’ faults for his
destruction, Volumnia arrives in the camp and makes her petition, which
her son at length grants though he foresees the result. The fifth is
occupied with his murder in the Senate House at Antium, and concludes
with his mother’s reception of the news.</p>

<p>Thus the sequence and selection of episodes are much the same in the
two tragedies, except that Hardy, perhaps, as I have said, owing to the
exigencies of his decorative system, does not begin till the exploit
at Corioli is over, and adds, as he could do so by using once more
Coriolanus’ house in Rome, the final scene with Volumnia. Otherwise the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
scaffolding of the plays is very similar, and it is because both follow
closely the excellent guidance of Plutarch. But it is interesting also
to note that some of their additions are similar, for when they were
independently made, it shows how readily Plutarch’s narrative suggested
such supplements. Thus, as in Shakespeare, but not as in Plutarch,
Volumnia counsels her son to bow his pride before the people, and he,
though in the end consenting, at first refuses.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Thus the machinations of Amfidius before the final

<p class="no-indent">In short, though Hardy’s drama, as compared with
Shakespeare’s, is a work of talent as compared with a work of genius,
it shows that the <i>Life</i> had in it the material for a tragedy
already rough-dressed, with indications, obvious to a practised
playwright, of some of the processes that still were needed.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, then, was now dealing with a much more tractable theme
than in his previous Roman plays, and this is evident in the finished
product. Technically and artistically it is a more perfect achievement
than either of them. In <i>Julius Caesar</i> the early disappearance
of the titular hero does not indeed affect the essential unity of
the piece, but it does, when all is said and done, involve, to the
feelings of most readers, a certain break in the interest. In <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> the scattering of the action through so many short
scenes does not interfere with the main conception, but it does make
the execution a little spasmodic. In both instances Shakespeare had
to suit his treatment to the material. But that material in the case
of <i>Coriolanus</i> offered less difficulty. It lay ready to the
dramatist’s hand and took the shape that he imposed, almost of itself.
The result is a masterpiece that, as an organic work of art, has been
placed on the level of Shakespeare’s most independent
tragedies.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is easy to see how the personality of the hero dominates the
complex story, as the heart transmits the life-blood through the body
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
and its members, and receives it back again; how his character contains
in itself the seeds of his offence and its reparation; how the other
figures are related to him in parallel and contrast; how the two grand
interests, the conflict between Coriolanus and Aufidius, the conflict
between Coriolanus and the people, intertwine, but always so that the
latter remains the principal strand; how the language is suited to the
persons, the circumstances, and the prevailing tone. In short, whatever
the relations in which we consider the play, they seem, like the radii
of a circle, to depart from and meet in one centre.</p>

<p>Hardly less admirable are the balance and composition of the whole,
which yet in no wise impair the interest of the individual scenes.
Dr. Johnson indeed makes the criticism: “There is perhaps too much
bustle in the first act and too little in the last.” This possibly is
more noticeable when the play is acted than when it is read; but it is
fitting that from the noise and hubbub of the struggle there should be
a transition to the outward quietude of the close that harmonises with
the inward acquiescence in the mind of reader or spectator. Nor is the
element of tumult entirely lacking at the last. To the uproar in the
street of Rome, where the life of Marcius is threatened, corresponds
the uproar in the public place of Antium where it is actually taken.
But Dr. Johnson was probably thinking of those battle scenes beloved by
Elizabethan audiences and generally wearisome to modern taste. There
are no fewer than five of them in the first act, a somewhat plentiful
allowance. But they are written by no means exclusively in the
drum-and-trumpet style. On the contrary they are rich in psychological
interest, and bring home to us many characteristics of the hero that we
have to realise. Not only are we witnesses of his prowess, but his pride
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>
in Rome, his contempt of baseness, his rivalry with Aufidius, his power
of rousing enthusiasm in the field, are all shown in relief. Such
things lift these concessions to temporary fashion above the level of
outworn crudities.</p>

<p>And the construction is very perfect too. Perhaps the crisis,
understood as the acme of Coriolanus’ success, when he is voted to
the consulship in the middle of the third scene of the second act
comes a little early. But crisis may bear another meaning. It may
denote the decisive point of the conflict, and this is only reached
in the centre of the play. To the supreme tension of the scenes that
describe Coriolanus’ denunciation of the Tribunes, the consultations
in his house, his final condemnation, all that goes before gradually
leads up, and from that all that follows after gradually declines. In
the first act we are introduced to the circumstances, the opposition
between the Romans and the Volsces, the Senate and the Plebs, and to
all the leading characters, as well as Coriolanus and his friends
and opponents, in an exposition that is not merely declaratory but
is full of action and life: and we see that the situation is fraught
with danger. In the second act we are shown more definitely how the
grand disaster will come from the collision of Coriolanus with the
people, and the cloud gathers even in the instant of his success. In
the third the storm breaks, and, despite a momentary lull, in the end
sweeps away all wonted landmarks. The fourth presents the change that
follows in the whole condition of things: the rival of Aufidius has
recourse to his generosity, the champion of Rome becomes her foe, and
the people, after its heedless triumph, is plunged into dismay. In the
fifth we proceed by carefully considered ways to the catastrophe: the
deliverance of Rome from material and the hero from moral perdition,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
the expiation of his passion in death and the fruitless triumph
of his rival.</p>

<p>But through this symmetrical rise and fall of the excitement, there is
no abatement of the interest. Attention and suspense are always kept on
the alert. They are secured partly by the diversity of the details and
the swiftness of the fluctuations. Dr. Johnson says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Tragedy of <i>Coriolanus</i> is one of the
most amusing of our author’s performances. The old man’s merriment in
Menenius, the lofty lady’s dignity in Volumnia, the bridal modesty
in Virgilia, the patrician and military haughtiness in Coriolanus,
the plebeian malignity and tribunitian insolence in Brutus and
Sicinius, make a very pleasing and interesting variety; and the
various revolutions of the hero’s fortune fill the mind with anxious
curiosity.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This is so because, while the agitation culminates
in the third act, the emotion is neither overtaxed in the two that
precede nor allowed to subside in the two that follow. For though this
movement, first of intensification, then of relaxation, is discernible
in the play as a whole, it is not uniform or uninterrupted. There is
throughout a throb and pulse, an ebb and flow. The quieter scenes
alternate with the more vehement: Coriolanus’ fortune by turns advances
and retires. Only when we reflect do we become aware that we have
risen so high out of our daily experience, and have returned “with new
acquist” of wisdom to a spot whence we can step back to it once more.</p>

<p>But to produce so consummate a masterpiece from the material of
history, no matter how dramatic that material was, Shakespeare was
bound to reshape it more freely than he was wont to do when dealing
with historical themes. We have seen from Hardy’s example what stores
of half-wrought treasure Plutarch’s narrative offered to a dramatist
who knew his business. Still it was only half-wrought, and in working it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
up Shakespeare consciously or unconsciously allowed himself more
liberties than in his other Roman plays. His loans indeed are none
the fewer or the less on that account; nowhere has he borrowed more
numerous or so lengthy passages. But it almost seems as though with the
tact of genius he had the feeling that he was at work, not on fact, but
on legend. Though he is far from recasting the Roman tradition as he
recast the pseudo-historic traditions of his own island in <i>Lear</i>
and <i>Macbeth</i>, yet he gives a new colouring to the picture as he
hardly does to genuine histories like <i>Richard II.</i> or <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i>.</p>

<p>This will appear from a comparison of the play with the <i>Life</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The first impression produced by a comparison of the biography and the
play is that the latter is little more than a scenic replica of the
former. Shakespeare has indeed absorbed so many suggestions from the
translation that it is difficult to realise how much he has modified
them, or to avoid reading these modifications into his authority when
we try to distinguish what he has received from what he has supplied.
And the illusion is confirmed by the frequency with which we light on
familiar words, familiar traits, familiar incidents. For the similarity
seems at first to pervade the language, the characterisation, and the
action.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>In the language it is most marked. Nowhere has Shakespeare borrowed
so much through so great a number of lines as in Volumnia’s appeal
to the piety of her son. This passage, even if it stood alone, would
serve to make the play a notable example of Shakespeare’s indebtedness
to North.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
But it does not stand alone. Somewhat shorter, but still longer than
any loan in the other plays, is Coriolanus’ announcement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span>
himself to Aufidius, and in it Shakespeare follows North even more
closely than in the former instance.</p>

<p class="blockquot">If thou knowest me not yet, Tullus, and seeing
me, dost not perhappes beleeve me to be the man I am in dede, I must
of necessitie bewraye my selfe to be that I am. I am that Caius
Martius, who hath done to thy self particularly, and to all the Volsces
generally, great hurte and mischief, which I cannot denie for my
surname of Coriolanus that I beare. For I never had other benefit nor
recompence, of all the true and paynefull service I have done, and the
extreme daungers I have bene in, but this only surname: a good memorie
and witnes, of the malice and displeasure thou showldest beare me. In
deede the name only remaineth with me: for the rest, the envie and
crueltie of the people of Rome have taken from me, by the sufference
of the dastardlie nobilitie and magistrates, who have forsaken me, and
let me be banished by the people. This extremitie hath now driven me
to come as a poore suter, to take thy chimney harthe, not of any hope
I have to save my life thereby. For if I had feared death, I would not
have come hither to have put my life in hazard: but prickt forward with
strife and desire I have to be revenged of them that thus have banished
me, whom now I beginne to be avenged on, putting my persone betweene
their enemies. Wherefore, if thou hast any harte to be
wrecked<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
of the injuries thy enemies have done thee, spede thee now, and let my
miserie serve thy turne, and so use it, as my service maye be a benefit
to the Volsces: promising thee, that I will fight with better good will
for all you, then ever I dyd when I was against you, knowing that they
fight more valliantly, who know the force of their enemie, then such
as have never proved it. And if it be so that thou dare not, and that
thou art wearye to prove fortune any more; then am I also weary to live
any lenger. And it were no wisedome in thee, to save the life of him,
who hath bene heretofore thy mortall enemie, and whose service now can
nothing helpe nor pleasure thee.</p>

As much material, though it is amplified and rearranged, has been
incorporated, as we shall have to point out, in Coriolanus’ invective
against the tribunate and the distribution of corn. Within a narrower
compass we see the same adherence to North’s phraseology in Brutus’
instructions to the people, where, very notably, Shakespeare’s fidelity
to his author has made it possible to supply an omission in the text
with absolute certainty as to the sense and great probability as to the
wording. The opening sentences of the <i>Life</i> run as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The house of the Martians at Rome was of the
number of the patricians, out of the which hath sprong many noble
personages: whereof Ancus Martius was one, King Numaes daughters sonne,
who was king of Rome after Tullus Hostilius. Of the same house were
Publius, and Quintus, who brought Rome their best water they had by
conducts. Censorinus also came of that familie, that was so surnamed,
bicause the people had chosen him Censor twise.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare puts the notifications in the
Tribune’s mouth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Say we read lectures to you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How youngly he began to serve his country,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How long continued, and what stock he springs of,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble house o’ the Marcians, from whence came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Ancus Martius, Numa’s daughter’s son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, after great Hostilius, here was king:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That our best water brought by conduits hither:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And Nobly nam’d, so twice being Censor,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Was his great Ancestor</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> iii. 242.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Many editors saw that something had dropped out,
but no attempt to fill the gap was satisfactory, till Delius, having
recourse to North, supplemented,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">And nobly named so, twice being censor.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
These lines also show how Shakespeare reproduces Plutarch’s statement
even when they are for him not quite in keeping. Plutarch, writing in
the second century, could instance Publius, Quintus and Censorinus as
ornaments of the Marcian gens; but Brutus’ reference to them is an
anachronism as they come after the supposed date of the play. So too
Plutarch says of the attack on the Romans before Corioli:</p>

<p class="blockquot">But Martius being there at that time, ronning out
of the campe with a fewe men with him, he slue the first enemies he met
withall, and made the rest of them staye upon a sodaine, crying out to
the Romaines that had turned their backes, and calling them againe to
fight with a lowde voyce. For he was even such another, as Cato would
have a souldier and a captaine to be: not only terrible, and fierce to
laye about him, but to make the enemie afeard with the sounde of his
voyce, and grimnes of his countenaunce.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare makes short work of chronology by
putting this allusion into the mouth of Titus Lartius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Thou wast a soldier</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even to Cato’s<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> wish, not fierce and terrible</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou madest thine enemies shake, as if the world</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were feverous and did tremble.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iv. 56.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Occasionally even mistakes in North’s text or
marginal notes, or in Shakespeare’s interpretation or recollection of
what he had read, have passed into the play. Thus it has been
shown<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
that North, owing to a small typographical error in the French,
misunderstood the scope of Cominius’ offer to Marcius. Amyot says:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">“Et en fin lui dit, que de <i>tous les
cheveaux prisonniers</i>, et autres biens qui avoient esté pris
et gaignés en grande quantité, il en choisist dix de chaque sorte à sa
volonté, avant que rien en fust distribué, ni desparti aux autres.”</p>

<p>There should be a comma after <i>cheveaux</i>, as appears on reference
to the Greek,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
and Marcius is told to select ten of the horses, prisoners, and other
chattels; but North took the <i>prisonniers</i> as used adjectivally in
agreement with the preceding noun and translated:</p>

<p class="blockquot">So in the ende he willed Martius, he should choose
<i>out of all the horses they had taken</i> of their enemies,
and of all the goodes they had wonne (whereof there was great store)
tenne of every sorte which he liked best, before any distribution
should be made to other.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Further there is the quite incorrect abridgment in
the margin:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The tenth parte of the enemies goods offered
Martius for rewarde of his service by Cominius the Consul.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare combines these misstatements:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Of all the horses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whereof we have ta’en good and good store, of all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The treasure in this field achieved and city,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We render you the tenth, to be ta’en forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the common distribution, at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your only choice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 31.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Of great frequency are the short sentences
from North that are embedded in Shakespeare’s dialogue. Thus, the
preliminary announcement of Marcius’ hardihood is introduced with the
remark:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now in those dayes, valliantnes was honoured
in Rome above all the other vertues.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Cominius begins his panegyric:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">It is held</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
When Marcius drives the Volscians back to Corioli and the Romans
hesitate to pursue, we are told:</p>

<p class="blockquot">He dyd encorage his fellowes with wordes and
deedes, crying out to them, that fortune had opened the gates of the
cittie more for the followers, then for the flyers.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Compare his exhortation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When the proposal to distribute the corn is being
discussed, many senators are in favour of it:</p>

<p class="no-indent">But Martius standing up on his feete, dyd somewhat
sharpely take up those, who went about to gratifie the people therein,
and called them people pleasers and traitours to the nobilitie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Brutus charges him with this in the play:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When corn was given them gratis, you repined;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scandal’d the suppliants for the people, call’d them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> i. 43.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Sometimes the debt is confined to a single phrase
or word and yet is unmistakable. When Coriolanus has reached Antium,
Plutarch quotes Homer on Ulysses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So dyd he enter into the enemies towne.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In the play Coriolanus before the house of
Aufidius soliloquises:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent19">My love’s upon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This enemy town. I’ll enter.</div>
    <div class="verse indent19">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> iv. 23.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Now and then some apparently haphazard detail can
be explained if we trace it to its source. Thus, Cominius talks of the
“seventeen battles” which the hero had fought since his first exploit.
Why seventeen? Doubtless Shakespeare had in his mind the account of the
candidature, when Marcius showed the wounds “which he had receyved in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>
seventeene yeres service at the warres, and in many sundrie battells.”
In Plutarch the number of years is prescribed by his mythical
chronology, for he dates the beginning of Marcius’ career from the wars
with the Tarquins, which were supposed to have broken out in 245 <span
class="smcap">a.u.c.</span>, while Corioli was taken in 262: but when
transferred to the battles it becomes a mere survival which serves at
most to give apparent definiteness.</p>

<p>But occasionally such survivals have a higher value. It is instructive,
for example, to notice how Shakespeare utilises the tradition dear
to Plutarch’s antiquarian tastes but not very interesting to an
Elizabethan audience of the acknowledgment made to the goddess,
<i>Fortuna Muliebris</i>, after the withdrawal of Coriolanus from Rome.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Senate ordeined, that the magistrates to
gratifie and honour these ladyes, should graunte them all that they
would require. And they only requested that they would build a temple
of Fortune of the women, for the building whereof they offered them
selves to defraye the whole charge of the sacrifices, and other
ceremonies belonging to the service of the goddes. Nevertheles, the
Senate commending their good will and forwardnes, ordeined, that the
temple and image should be made at the common charge of the cittie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">And the marginal note sums up: “The temple of
Fortune built for the women.” This seems to be the archaeological ore
from which is forged Coriolanus’ gallant hyperbole:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent17">Ladies, you deserve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To have a temple built you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 206.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">From the worshippers they become the worshipped.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the survival the fact is transformed to figure, the prose
to poetry. After Marcius’ miracles of valour at Corioli, Cominius gives
him, “in testimonie that he had wonne that day the price of prowes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
above all other, a goodly horse with a capparison, and all furniture to
him.” This Shakespeare does not omit. Cominius declares:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Caius Marcius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wears this war’s garland: in token of the which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My noble steed,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> known to the camp, I give him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With all his trim belonging.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 59.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the same episode furnishes Titus Lartius with
his imagery as he points to the wounded and victorious hero:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">O general,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here is the steed, we the caparison!</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 11.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This illustrates the sort of sea-change that
always takes place in the language of North under the hands of the
magician, though it may not always be equally perceptible. But it
is never entirely lacking, even where we are at first more struck
by the amount that Shakespeare has retained without alteration. The
<i>Life</i>, for instance, describes what takes place after Marcius has
joined Cominius, before they hurry off to the second fight.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Martius asked him howe the order of their enemies
battell was, and on which side they had placed their best fighting
men. The Consul made him aunswer, that he thought the bandes which
were in the voward of their battell, were those of the Antiates, whom
they esteemed to be the war-likest men, and which for valliant corage
would give no place, to any of the hoste of their enemies. Then prayed
Martius to be set directly against them.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Here is what Shakespeare makes of this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Mar.</i> How lies their battle? Know you on which side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They have placed their men of trust?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Com.</i><span class="ws4">As I guess, Marcius,</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their bands in the vaward are the Antiates,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of their best trust; o’er them Aufidius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their very heart of hope.
                     <span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Mar.</i><span class="ws4">I do beseech you,</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By all the battles wherein we have fought,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By the blood we have shed together, by the vows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We have made to endure friends, that you directly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that you not delay the present, but,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We prove this very hour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> vi. 51.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here to begin with Shakespeare hardly does more
than change the indirect to the direct narrative and condense a
little, but presently he adds picturesqueness, passion, and, by the
introduction of Aufidius, dramatic significance. And this is invariably
his method. It is unfair to quote the parallel passages without the
context, for, apart from the subtle transmutation they have undergone,
they are preludes to original utterance and almost every one of
them is a starting point rather than the goal. Shakespeare’s normal
practice is illustrated in the fable of Menenius, in which, with every
allowance made for possible assistance from Camden, the words of his
authority or authorities are only so many spur-pricks that set his own
imagination at a gallop. And what goes before and comes after is pure
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>And it should be noticed that his textual appropriations from North,
long or short, obvious or covert, never clash with his more personal
contributions, which in bulk are far more important. They are all
subdued to the tone that the purpose of the dramatist imposes.
Delius says with absolute truth: “This harmonious colouring would
make it impossible for us, in respect of style, to discover real
or suppositious loans from Plutarch in Shakespeare’s drama, and
definitely identify them as such, if by chance North’s translation were
inaccessible.” Yet this harmonious colouring, that has its source in
the author’s mind and that is required by the theme, does not prevent
an individualisation in the utterance, whether wholly original or partly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
borrowed, that fits it for the lips of the particular speaker. The
language, even when it is suggested by North, is not only spontaneous
and consistent, it is dramatic as well, and apposite to the strongly
marked characters of whom the story is told.</p>

<p>To these characters, and their development by Shakespeare, we now
turn. It may be remarked that all of them, except the quite episodical
Adrian and Nicanor, are nominally to be found in Plutarch, by whom
the hero himself is drawn at full length and in great detail. For his
delineation then there was a great deal to borrow and Shakespeare
has borrowed a great deal. In his general bearing and in many of
his features the Coriolanus of the play is the Coriolanus of the
<i>Life</i>, though of course imagined with far more firmness and
comprehension. Only on very close scrutiny do we see that each has a
physiognomy of his own, and that the difference in the impressions
they produce is due not merely to the execution but to the conception.
This will become clear as the general discussion proceeds and will
incidentally occupy our attention from time to time. Meanwhile it
should be noticed that, Coriolanus excepted, Plutarch’s persons are
very shadowy and vague. If we compare this biography with those that
Shakespeare had used for his earlier Roman plays, it is obvious that it
is much more of a monograph. In the others room is found for sketches
of many subordinate figures in connection with the titular subject, but
Marcius stands out alone and the remaining personages are scarcely more
than names. In the tragedy, too, he is in possession of the scene, but
his relatives, his friends, and his enemies are also full of interest
and life; and for their portraiture Shakespeare had to depend almost
entirely on himself.</p>

<p>Next to the hero, for example, it is his mother who is most conspicuous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span>
in the play; and how much did Plutarch contribute to the conception of
her concrete personality? He supplies only one or two hints, some of
which Shakespeare disregards or contradicts. They both attribute to her
the sole training of the boy, but Plutarch implies that her discipline
was slack and her instruction insufficient, while in Shakespeare she
incurs no such blame except in so far as we infer a certain lack of
judiciousness from her peculiar attitude to her grandson and from her
son’s exaggeration of some of her own traits. But injudiciousness is
not quite the same as the laxity that Plutarch’s apologetic paragraph
would insinuate:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Caius Martius, whose life we intend now to write,
being left an orphan by his father, was brought up under his mother
a widowe, who taught us by experience, that orphanage bringeth many
discommodities to a childe, but doth not hinder him to become an honest
man, and to excell in vertue above the common sorte; as they, are
meanely borne, wrongfully doe complayne, that it is the occasion of
their casting awaye, for that no man in their youth taketh any care of
them to see them well brought up, and taught that were meete. This man
is also a good proofe to confirme some mens opinions, that a rare and
excellent witte untaught, doth bring forth many good and evill things
together; like as a fat soile bringeth forth herbes and weedes, that
lieth unmanured.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
For this Martius naturell wit and great harte dyd marvelously
sturre up his corage, to doe and attempt notable actes. But on the
other side for lacke of education, he was so chollericke and impacient,
that he would yeld to no living creature; which made him churlishe,
uncivill, and altogether unfit for any mans conversation.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Again, in reference to Marcius’ strenuous career,
Plutarch writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The only thing that made him to love honour, was
the joye he sawe his mother dyd take of him. For he thought nothing
made him so happie and honorable, as that his mother might heare every
bodie praise and commend him, that she might allwayes see him returne
with a crowne upon his head, and that she might still embrace him with
teares ronning downe her cheekes for joye.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>
In the play, it is not with tears of joy that Volumnia welcomes her
warrior home.</p>

<p>Here is another instance of piety that Plutarch cites:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Martius thinking all due to his mother, that had
bene also due to his father if he had lived; dyd not only content him
selfe to rejoyce and honour her, but at her desire tooke a wife also,
by whom he had two children, and yet never left his mothers house
therefore.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In Shakespeare there is no word of Marcius’
marrying at his mother’s desire, and though she apparently lives with
him, it is in his, not in her house.</p>

<p>All these notices occur in the first pages of the <i>Life</i>.
Thenceforward till her intervention at the close there is only a
passing mention of her affliction at her son’s banishment.</p>

<p class="blockquot">When he was come home to his house againe, and
had taken his leave of his mother and wife, finding them weeping, and
shreeking out for sorrowe, and had also comforted and persuaded them
to be content with his chaunce; he immediately went to the gate of the
cittie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Even in regard to the intercession, where
Shakespeare follows Plutarch most closely, he makes one significant
omission. In the original, it is the suggestion of Valeria “through
the inspiration of some god above,” that the women should sue for
peace, and she visits Marcius’ kinswoman to secure their help: by
the suppression of this circumstance, the prominent place is left to
Volumnia. And in the appeal itself Shakespeare, besides the various
vivifying and personal touches, makes one important addition. In
Plutarch her words are throughout forcible and impassioned, but they do
not burst into the wrathful indignation of the close, which alone is
sufficient to break down Coriolanus’ resolution.</p>

<p>Now it is clear that the presence of Volumnia does not pervade the
<i>Life</i> as it does the play, and she has not nearly so much to do.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
Moreover, besides being less important, she is less masculine and
masterful. Indeed, from Plutarch’s hints it would be possible
to construct for her a character that differed widely from that of
Shakespeare’s heroine. She is like the latter in her patriotism, her
love for and delight in her son, and, at the critical moment, in her
influence over him. But even her influence is less constant, and
seems to be stronger in the way of unconscious inspiration than of
positive direction. It would be quite legitimate to picture her as an
essentially womanly woman, high-souled and dutiful, but finding her
chosen sphere in the home, overflowing with sympathy and affection,
and failing in her obligations as widowed mother only by a lack of
sternness.</p>

<p>And if Shakespeare has given features to Volumnia, much more has he
done so to Virgilia and young Marcius. Both, of course, are presented
in the merest outline, but in Plutarch the wife is only once named and
the children are not named at all. Shakespeare’s Virgilia, on the other
hand, by the few words she speaks and the few words spoken to her, by
her very restraint from speech and the atmosphere in which she moves,
produces a very definite as well as a very pleasing impression. Ruskin,
after enumerating some other of Shakespeare’s female characters,
concludes that they “and last and perhaps loveliest, Virgilia, are all
faultless; conceived in the highest heroic type of humanity.” This
enthusiasm may be, as Ruskin’s enthusiasms sometimes were, exaggerated
and misplaced, but it could not be roused by a nonentity; and a
nonentity Plutarch’s Virgilia is.</p>

<p>Young Marcius, again, is not merely one of the two children mentioned
in the <i>Life</i>. As Mr. Verity remarks,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
in this case “the half is certainly better than the whole”; and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</span>
named half has a wholeness of his own that the anonymous brace can lay
no claim to. He is a thorough boy, and an attractive though boisterous
one. If he is cruel to winged things, he is brave and circumspect
withal. He has a natural objection to be trodden on even for a
patriotic cause; if the risk is too great, “he’ll run away till he’s
bigger, but then he’ll fight.”</p>

<p>Passing from Coriolanus’ kinsfolk to his friends, we meet with
very similar results. Titus Lartius is sketched very slightly in
Shakespeare, but a good deal more visually than in Plutarch, who says
of him in two sentences that he was “one of the valliantest men the
Romaines had at that time,” and that, having entered Corioli with
Marcius, he, “when he was gotten out, had some leysure to bring the
Romaines with more safetie into the cittie.” Cominius is hardly more
distinct. As Consul he conducts the campaign against Corioli; welcomes
Marcius from his first exploit, and gives him the opportunity for his
second, in the double engagement that then took place; thereafter
officially rewards and eulogises his gallantry, which “he commended
beyond the moone”; and that is practically all that is said about
him. In the play, though in it too his part was a small one, he has
characteristics of his own which Shakespeare has created for him
without much help from these vague suggestions. Nor has Marcius, in
the original story, any intimate association with either of his fellow
soldiers. It is stated that at first he is in Lartius’ division of the
army, and afterwards joins Cominius and wins his praises, but it is
only in the affair of Corioli that their names are mentioned together.</p>

<p>In the drama, however, Menenius is undoubtedly the chief of the young
man’s friends as well as one of the most prominent persons; and what
has Plutarch to say about him? He is introduced only in connection with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
the fable which he tells the seceders to the Holy Hill, and, apart from
the fable, all that we hear of him is confined to the following few
sentences:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Senate being afeard of their departure, dyd
send unto them certaine of the pleasauntest olde men, and the most
acceptable to the people among them. Of those, Menenius Agrippa was he,
who was sent for chief man of the message from the Senate. He, after
many good persuasions and gentle requestes made to the people, on the
behalfe of the Senate, knit up his oration in the ende, with a notable
tale.... These persuasions pacified the people, conditionally, that the
Senate would graunte there should be yerely chosen five magistrates,
which they now call <i>Tribuni Plebis</i>.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Even the few particulars given in this passage
Shakespeare alters or neglects. It is not to the secessionists on
the Mons Sacer, but to a street mob in Rome, that the fable is told.
It not merely serves to lubricate in advance the negotiations that
result in the tribunate, but effectually discomfits the murmurers, and
Menenius learns only subsequently and to his surprise that the Senate
has meanwhile conceded the political innovation. There is no hint in
Plutarch of his being himself one of the patricians, and if Shakespeare
glanced at Holland’s Livy he would see that in point of fact tradition
assigned to him a plebeian origin.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Above all he has no dealings whatever with Marcius, and, according
to Livy, died a year before his banishment. Plutarch thus furnishes
hardly anything for the portrait of the man, and nothing at all for his
relations with the hero.</p>

<p>And it is the same, or nearly the same, if we turn from Marcius’
friends to his enemies.</p>

<p>The tribunes, for example, are comparatively colourless. On the
institution of the new magistracy,</p>

<p class="blockquot">Junius Brutus, and Sicinius Vellutus were the
first tribunes of the people that were chosen, who had only bene the
causes and procurers of this sedition.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>
Then we hear of their opposition to the colonisation of Velitrae
because it was infected with the plague, and to a new war with the
Volscians, because it was in the interest only of the rich; but they
have nothing to do with the rejection of Marcius when he is candidate
for the consulship. Only at a later time, when he inveighs against
the relief of the people and the tribunitian power, do they stir up a
popular tumult and insist that he shall answer their charges, adopting
tactics not unlike those that are attributed to them in the play.</p>

<p class="blockquot">All this was spoken to one of these two endes,
either that Martius against his nature should be constrained to
humble him selfe, and to abase his hawty and fierce minde: or els if
he continued still in his stowtnes, he should incurre the peoples
displeasure and ill-will so farre, that he should never possibly winne
them againe. Which they hoped would rather fall out so, then otherwise;
as in deede they gest unhappely, considering Martius nature and
disposition.</p>

<p class="no-indent">He answers not only with his wonted boldness, but
“gave him selfe in his wordes to thunder and looke therewithall so
grimly as though he made no reckoning of the matter.” This affords his
opponents their chance:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Whereupon Sicinius, the cruellest and stowtest of
the Tribunes, after he had whispered a little with his companions, dyd
openly pronounce in the face of all the people, Martius as condemned by
the Tribunes to dye.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Matters do not end here. A formal trial is
agreed to, at which the resourceful magistrates procure the sentence
of banishment, partly by arranging that the votes shall be taken not
by centuries but by tribes, so that “the poore needy people” and the
rabble may be in the majority, partly by eking out the indictments to
which they are pledged to confine themselves, with other accusations.
Then they drop out.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span></p>

<p>It may be observed that Brutus is only once named, and nothing is said
of his disposition or ways. Even of Sicinius, who is more conspicuous,
we only read that he was “the cruellest and stowtest” of the two. But
it is less their character than their policy that occupies Plutarch,
and even their policy is presented in an ambiguous light. They are
described as the only authors of the rising which culminated in the
exodus from the city; but with that exodus Plutarch on the whole seems
to sympathise. They are described as “seditious tribunes” when they
oppose the colonisation of Velitrae and the renewal of the war; but
Plutarch shows they had good grounds for doing so. Even their action
against Coriolanus for opposing the grant of corn and advocating the
abolition of their office, was from their own point of view, and
perhaps from any point of view, perfectly legitimate. We can only say
that in the measures they took they were violent and unscrupulous. Yet
when we consider the bitterness of party feeling and the exigencies
of public life, they seem no worse than many statesmen who have been
accounted great. Even their overt policy then is more respectable
than that of Shakespeare’s pair of demagogues, and of course it is
Shakespeare who has created, or all but created, for them their vulgar
but life-like characters.</p>

<p>Nor are things greatly different in the case of the third of Marcius’
enemies, Tullus Aufidius, though Plutarch tells us somewhat more about
him, and Shakespeare in the main fills in rather than alters Plutarch’s
sketch. The first mention of him occurs when the exile determines on
his revenge.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now in the cittie of Antium, there was one
called Tullus Aufidius, who for his riches, as also for his nobilitie
and valliantnes, was honoured emong the Volsces as a king. Martius
knewe very well that Tullus dyd more malice and envie him, then he dyd
all the Romaines besides: bicause that many times in battells where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
they met, they were ever
at the encounter one against another, like lustie coragious youthes,
striving in all emulation of honour, and had encountered many times
together. In so muche, as besides the common quarrell betweene them,
there was bred a marvelous private hate one against another. Yet
notwithstanding, considering that Tullus Aufidius was a man of a greate
minde, and that he above all other of the Volsces, most desired revenge
of the Romaines, for the injuries they had done unto them; he dyd an
act that confirmed the true wordes of an auncient Poet, who sayed:</p>

<p>It is a thing full harde, mans anger to withstand.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">After the welcome at Antium, Tullus and Coriolanus
combine to bring on the war and are entrusted with the joint command;
but Tullus chooses to remain at home to defend his country, while
Coriolanus conducts the operations abroad, in which he is wonderfully
successful. A truce he grants the Romans is however the occasion for a
rift in their alliance.</p>

<p class="blockquot">This was the first matter wherewith the Volsces
(that most envied Martius glorie and authoritie) dyd charge Martius
with. Among those, Tullus was chief: who though he had receyved no
private injurie or displeasure of Martius, yet the common faulte and
imperfection of mans nature wrought in him, and it grieved him to see
his owne reputation bleamished, through Martius great fame and honour,
and so him selfe to be lesse esteemed of the Volsces, then he was
before.</p>

<p class="no-indent">We do not hear of him after this till Coriolanus
has come back from the siege of Rome.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now when Martius was returned againe into the
cittie of Antium from his voyage, Tullus that hated him and could no
lenger abide him for the feare he had of his authoritie; sought divers
meanes to make him out of the waye, thinking that if he let slippe
that present time, he should never recover the like and fit occasion
againe.</p>

<p class="no-indent">So he contrives and effects the assassination of
his rival.</p>

<p>Thus the chief features of Aufidius’ character and the story of its
development, the emulation that is dislodged by generosity, the
generosity that is submerged in envy, were already supplied for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>
Shakespeare’s use. But the darker hues are lacking in the earlier
picture. There is neither the unscrupulous rancour in his initial
relations with Marcius that Shakespeare attributes to them, nor the
hypocritical pretence at the close. Plutarch does not bring the
contrast with Coriolanus to a head. And in connection with this it
should be observed that Tullus appears late and intervenes only
incidentally. Less than a sentence is spared to his earlier antagonism
with Coriolanus, nor is he present in the march on Rome or during
the siege. And this is typical of Plutarch’s treatment of all the
subordinate persons. They enter for a moment, and are dismissed. But
in Shakespeare they accompany the action throughout, and do this in
such a way that they illustrate and influence the character and career
of the hero, and have their own characters and careers illustrated and
influenced by him. They are all, even young Marcius by description,
introduced in the first four scenes, with an indication of their
general peculiarities and functions, and with the single exception of
Titus Lartius, they continue to reappear almost to the end.</p>

<p>The recurrent presence of the agents of itself involves considerable
modification in the conduct of the plot, but in this respect too we are
at first more struck by the resemblances than the differences between
the two versions; and it is possible to exhibit the story in such a
manner that its main lines seem the same in both.</p>

<p>The setting is furnished by the primitive Roman state when it has
newly assumed its republican form. Less than a score of years before,
it passed through its first great crisis in its successful rejection
of the kingship, and ever since has been engaged in a life-and-death
struggle with representatives of the exiled dynasty and with jealous
neighbours somewhat similar in power and character to itself. It has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
made good its position under the direction of a proud and valiant
aristocracy, but not without paying the price. The constant wars have
resulted in widespread poverty and distress among the lower classes
till they can bear it no longer and demand constitutional changes by
which, as they think, their misery may be redressed. Rome is thus
confronted with the internal peril of revolution as well as the foreign
peril of invasion, and the future mistress of the world runs the
risk of being cut off at the outset of her career by tribal broils
and domestic quarrels. It is this that gives the legend a certain
grandeur of import. The Senate, finding itself and its partisans in
the minority, concedes to the commons rights which have the effect of
weakening its old authority, and for that reason are bitterly resented
by upholders of the old order. Meanwhile, however, Rome is able to take
the field against the Volscians and gains a decisive victory over them,
mainly owing to the soldiership of the young patrician, Marcius, who
wins for himself in the campaign the name of Coriolanus. The ability he
has shown, the glory he has achieved, the gratitude that is his due,
seem to mark him out for a leading role. He almost deserves, and almost
attains, the highest dignity the little state has to confer: but he has
already given proof of his scorn for popular demands and opposition to
the recent innovations, and at the last moment he is set aside. Not
only that, but the new magistrates, in dread of his influence, incite
the people against him and procure his condemnation to death, which,
however, is afterwards mitigated to banishment. His friends of the
nobility dare not or cannot interpose, and he departs into exile. Then
his civic virtue breaks beneath the strain, and, reconciling himself
with the Volscians, he leads them against his country. Nothing can stay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>
his advance, and he is on the point of reducing the city, when,
yielding to filial affection what he had refused to patriotic
obligation, he relinquishes his revenge when he has it within his
grasp. But this gives a pretext to those among his new allies who envy
his greatness, and soon afterwards he is treacherously slain.</p>

<p>This general scheme is common to the biography and the play, and many
of the details, whether presented or recounted, are derived from the
former by the latter. Such, in addition to those already mentioned
in another connection, are Marcius’ first exploit in the battle with
Tarquin, when he bestrides a citizen, avenges his injury, and is
crowned with the garland of oak; the dispersion of the soldiers to take
spoil in Corioli, and Marcius’ consequent indignation; the response to
his call for volunteers; his petition on behalf of his former host;
the initial approval of his candidature by the plebs from a feeling of
shame; the custom of candidates wearing the humble gown and showing
their old wounds at an election; the popular joy at his banishment;
the muster of nobles to see him to the gates; his popularity with
the Volscian soldiery and their eagerness to serve under him; the
perturbation and mutual recriminations in Rome at his approach; his
reception of former friends when they petition him for mercy; the
device of interrupting his speech in Antium lest his words should
secure his acquittal.</p>

<p>To this extent Shakespeare and Plutarch agree, and the agreement is
important and far-reaching. Has the dramatist, then, been content
to embellish and supplement the diction of the story, and give new
life to the characters, while leaving the fable unchanged except in
so far as these other modifications may indirectly affect it? On the
contrary we shall see that the design is thoroughly recast, that each
of the borrowed details receives a new interpretation or a heightened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span>
colouring, that significant insertions and no less significant
omissions concur to alter the effect of the whole.</p>

<p>Sometimes Shakespeare’s innovations followed almost necessarily and
without any remoter result from the greater fullness and concreteness
of his picture, and the care with which he grouped the persons round
his hero. Such are many of the conversations and subordinate scenes,
by means of which the story is conveyed to us in all its reality and
movement; the episode of Valeria’s call, the description and words of
Marcius’ little son, Aufidius’ self-disclosure to his soldiers and his
lieutenant, even the interview between the Volscian scout and the Roman
informer.</p>

<p>Still in this class, but more important, are the inventions that have
no authority in Plutarch, but that are not opposed to and may even
have been suggested by some of his hints. Thus in the <i>Life</i>,
Volumnia’s interposition is not required to make Marcius submit himself
to the judgment of the people, and in this connection she is not
mentioned at all; but at any rate her action in Shakespeare does not
belie the influence that Plutarch ascribes to her.</p>

<p>Occasionally, again, the deviation from and observance of the
biographer’s statements follow each other so fast, and are both so
dominated by truth to his spirit, that it needs some vigilance to note
all the points where the routes diverge or coincide. Take, for example,
the account of the candidature:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Shortely after this, Martius stoode for the
Consulshippe; and the common people favored his sute, thinking it would
be a shame to denie, and refuse, the chiefest noble man of bloude, and
most worthie persone of Rome, and specially him that had done so great
service and good to the common wealth. For the custome of Rome was at
that time, that such as dyd sue for any office, should for certen dayes
before be in the market place, only with a poore gowne on their backes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
and without any coate underneath, to praye the cittizens to remember
them at the daye of election: which was thus devised, either to move
the people the more, by requesting them in suche meane apparell, or
els bicause they might shewe them their woundes they had gotten in the
warres in the service of the common wealth, as manifest markes and
testimonie of their valliantnes.... Now Martius following this custome,
shewed many woundes and cuttes upon his bodie, which he had receyved in
seventeene yeres service at the warres, and in many sundrie battells,
being ever the formest man that dyd set out feete to fight. So that
there was not a man emong the people, but was ashamed of him selfe,
to refuse so valliant a man: and one of them sayed to another, “We
must needes chuse him Consul, there is no remedie.” But when the daye
of election was come, and that Martius came to the market place with
great pompe, accompanied with all the Senate, and the whole Nobilitie
of the cittie about him, who sought to make him Consul, with the
greatest instance and intreatie they could, or ever attempted for any
man or matter: then the love and good will of the common people, turned
straight to an hate and envie toward him, fearing to put this office
of soveraine authoritie into his handes, being a man somewhat partiall
toward the nobilitie, and of great credit and authoritie amongest the
Patricians, and as one they might doubt would take away alltogether the
libertie from the people.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Now Shakespeare borrows from Plutarch the
explanation of the rather remarkable circumstance that the people at
first gave Martius their support, and, like Plutarch, he emphasises it
by giving it twice over, though he avoids the dullness of repetition by
making one of the statements serious and one humorous. The first is put
in the mouth of the official of the Capitol:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He hath so planted his honours in their eyes,
and his actions in their hearts, that for their tongues to be silent,
and not confess so much, were a kind of ingrateful injury: to report
otherwise, were a malice, that giving itself the lie, would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</p>

<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 1.)</p>
</div>

<p>But this is only before he wears the candidate’s gown, for, otherwise
than in Plutarch, he does not show his wounds—“No man saw them,” say
the citizens (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> iii. 173)—and gives such
offence by his contumacy that it is on this the tribunes are able to
take further action. In the biography he is rejected only because the
indiscreet advocacy of the nobles makes the plebeians fear that he
will be too much of a partizan. He shows no reluctance either to stand
or to comply with the conditions. All these things are the inventions
of Shakespeare, and are made to bring about the catastrophe which in
his authority was due to very different causes. Nevertheless, they
are suggested by Plutarch in so far as they are merely additional
illustrations of that excess of aristocratic pride, on which Plutarch,
too, insists as the source of Marcius’ offences and misfortunes.</p>

<p>But this example merges into another kind of alteration which may
primarily have been due to the need of greater economy and dramatic
condensation, but which in its results involves a great deal more. In
Plutarch, Coriolanus’ unsuccessful candidature has, except as it adds
to his private irritation, no immediate result; and only some time
later does his banishment follow on quite another occasion. Corn had
come from Sicily, and in the dearth it was proposed to distribute it
gratis: but Marcius inveighed against such a course and urged that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>
time was opportune for the abolition of the Tribunate, in a speech
which, in the play, he “speaks again” when his election is challenged.
But the <i>Life</i> reports it only as delivered in the Senate; and the
tribunes, who are present, at once leave and raise a tumult, attempt
to arrest him and are resisted. The senators, to allay the commotion,
resolve to sell the corn cheap, and thus end the discontent against
themselves, but the tribunes persist in their attack on the ringleader,
hoping, as we have seen, that he will prove refractory and give a
handle against himself. When he does this and the death-sentence is
pronounced, there is still so much feeling of fairness that a legal
trial is demanded, which the tribunes consent to grant him, and to
which he consents to submit on the stipulation that he shall be
charged only on the one count of aspiring to make himself king. But
when the assembly is held the tribunes break their promise and accuse
him of seeking to withhold the corn and abolish the Tribunate, and of
distributing the spoils of the Antiates only among his own followers.
For shortly after the fall of Corioli, the people had refused to march
against the Volsces, and Coriolanus, organising a private expedition,
had won a victory, taken great booty, and given it to all those who had
been of the party. So the unexpectedness and injustice of this last
indictment throws him out.</p>

<p class="blockquot">This matter was most straunge of all to Martius,
looking least to have been burdened with that, as with any matter of
offence. Whereupon being burdened on the sodaine, and having no ready
excuse to make even at that instant: he beganne to fall a praising of
the souldiers that had served with him in that jorney. But those that
were not with him, being the greater number, cried out so lowde, and
made such a noyse, that he could not be heard. To conclude, when they
came to tell the voyces of the Tribes, there were three voyces odde,
which condemned him to be banished for life.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Now there are several things to notice in Shakespeare’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
very different version. The first is the tact with which he compresses
a great many remotely connected incidents into one. He antedates the
affair about the corn with Marcius’ speech against the distribution and
the Tribunate, and only brings it in as a supplementary circumstance
in the prosecution. The real centre of the situation is Coriolanus’
behaviour when a candidate, and round this all else is grouped: and
this behaviour, it will be remembered, is altogether a fabrication on
Shakespeare’s part. Two other things follow from this.</p>

<p>In the first place, the unreasonableness of the Romans as a whole
is considerably mitigated. More prominence, indeed, is given to the
machinations of the tribunes, but on the other hand the body of
electors is not only acting less on its own initiative than on the
prompting of its guides, but it proceeds quite properly to avenge
grievances that do exist and avert dangers that do threaten. And this
excuse is to some extent valid for the leaders too. In Plutarch, the
Senate has come to terms on the question of the corn, yet Coriolanus is
hounded down for an opposition which has turned out to be futile. In
the play, though he has met with a check, both he and his friends hope
that even now he may win the election, and the evils that would result
to the people from his consulship are still to be feared.</p>

<p>Again, Plutarch dwells on the unfairness of the arrangements for taking
the votes, which has the effect of packing the jury:</p>

<p class="blockquot">And first of all the Tribunes would in any case
(whatsoever became of it) that the people would proceede to geve their
voyces by Tribes, and not by hundreds: for by this meanes the multitude
of the poore needy people (and all such rabble as had nothing to lose,
and had lesse regard of honestie before their eyes) came to be of
greater force (bicause their voyces were numbered by the polle) then
the noble honest cittizens: whose persones and purse dyd duetifully
serve the common wealth in their warres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span>
This is not exactly omitted in the drama, but it is slurred over, and
Plutarch’s clear explanation is entirely suppressed, so that few of
Shakespeare’s readers and still fewer of his hearers could possibly
suspect the significance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>Above all, the accusations brought against Coriolanus, in Shakespeare,
are substantially just. He may not seek to wind himself into a power
tyrannical, if we take <i>tyrant</i>, as Plutarch certainly did but
as Shakespeare probably did not, in the strict classical sense of
<i>tyrannus</i>, but with his disregard of aged custom and his avowed
opinions of the people, there can be no doubt that he would have
wielded the consular powers tyrannically, in the ordinary acceptation
of the word. For there can be as little doubt about his ill-will to the
masses and his abhorrence of the tribunitian system. And it is on these
grounds that he is condemned. It is very noticeable that the division
of the Antiate spoil, which in Plutarch is the most decisive and
unwarrantable allegation against him, is mentioned by Shakespeare only
in advance as a subordinate point that may be brought forward, but, as
a matter of fact, it is never urged.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare makes no further use of a circumstance
to which Plutarch attaches so great importance that he dwells on it
twice over and gives it the prominent place in the narrative of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
trial. This piece of sharp practice becomes quite negligible in the
play, and the only chicanery of which the tribunes are guilty in the
whole transaction is that, as in the <i>Life</i>, but more explicitly,
they goad Coriolanus to a fit of rage in which he avows his real
sentiments—a tactical expedient that many politicians would consider
perfectly permissible. Shakespeare, as has often been pointed out, in
some ways shows even less appreciation than Plutarch of the merits of
the people; so it is all the more significant that, at the crisis of
the play, he softens down and obliterates the worst traits in their
proceedings against their enemy.</p>

<p>And the second thing we observe is that by all this Shakespeare
emphasises the insolence and truculence of the hero. It is Coriolanus’
pride that turns his candidature, which begins under the happiest
auspices, to a snare. It is still his pride that plays into the
tribunes’ hands and makes him repeat in mere defiance his offensive
speech. It is again his pride, not any calumny about his misapplying
the profits of his raid, that gives the signal for the adverse
sentence. Just as in this respect the plebs is represented as on the
whole less ignoble than Plutarch makes it, so Coriolanus’ conduct is
portrayed as more insensate.</p>

<p>And this two-fold tendency, to palliate the guilt of Rome and to stress
the violence that provoked it, appears in the more conspicuous of
Shakespeare’s subsequent deviations from his authority.</p>

<p>In Plutarch, Tullus and Aufidius have great difficulty in persuading
the magnates of Antium to renew the war, and only succeed when the
Romans expel the Volscian residents from their midst.</p>

<p class="blockquot">On a holy daye common playes being kept in Rome,
apon some suspition, or false reporte, they made proclamation by sound
of trumpet, that all the Volsces should avoyde out of Rome before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
sunne set. Some thincke this was a crafte and deceipt of Martius,
who sent one to Rome to the Consuls, to accuse the Volsces falsely,
advertising them howe they had made a conspiracie to set upon them,
whilest they were busie in seeing these games, and also to sette their
cittie a fyre.</p>

<p class="no-indent">At any rate, the proclamation brings about a
declaration of hostilities, and war speedily follows.</p>

<p>Now in Shakespeare, Lartius, for fear of attack, has to surrender
Corioli even before Coriolanus meets with his rebuff.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i> Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Lartius.</i> He had, my lord, and that it was which caused</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our swifter composition.</div>
    <div class="verse indent36">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Moreover, all the preparations of the Volsces are
complete for a new incursion. Cominius, indeed, cannot believe that
they will again tempt fortune so soon.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">They are worn, lord consul, so</div>

    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 6.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But Cominius is wrong. In the little intercalated
scene between the Roman and the Volsce, we learn that they have
mustered an army which the latter thus describes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A most royal one; the centurions and their charges, distinctly

<p class="no-indent">And Aufidius welcomes Coriolanus to the feast with

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The arrival of such an auxiliary, however, at once
alters that plan, and we presently learn that they are now going to
make direct for the city:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
Now in Plutarch we cannot but be struck by the pusillanimous part
the Romans play when menaced by their great peril. They answer the
declaration of war with a bravado which events quite fail to justify,
but, despite the warning they have received, they make no resistance
and do not even prepare for it. In Shakespeare there is more excuse for
them. They are taken completely by surprise. Their foe has almost been
their match before, when they were equipped to meet him, and had their
champion on their side. Now that champion is not only gone, but is at
the head of the invading army.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. In Plutarch, Coriolanus begins operations by making
a raid on the Roman territories with light-armed troops, retiring
again with his plunder. Still the Romans do not take any precautions.
In a second campaign he gets within five miles of the city, and still
they do nothing but send an embassage. Even when, at the peril of his
popularity, he grants them a truce of thirty days, they make no use
of it for defence, but only continue to transmit arrogant or abject
messages. This further opportunity, too, which they so strangely
neglect, is wisely omitted by Shakespeare. With him the irruption is
swift and sudden beyond the grasp of human thought. Coriolanus breaks
across the border and strikes straight for Rome. There is no time
for defensive measures, no possibility of aid. Even so, the part the
Romans play is not so heroic as might be expected, but it is at least
intelligible and much less dastardly than in the history.</p>

<p>Or take another instance. In describing the first inroad of Coriolanus,
Plutarch writes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">His chiefest purpose was, to increase still the
malice and dissention betweene the nobilitie, and the communaltie: and
to drawe that on, he was very carefull to keepe the noble mens landes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
and goods safe from harme and burning, but spoyled all the whole
countrie besides, and would suffer no man to take or hurte any thing
of the noble mens. This made greater sturre and broyle betweene the
nobilitie and people, then was before. For the noble men fell out with
the people, bicause they had so unjustly banished a man of so great
valure and power. The people on thother side, accused the nobilitie,
how they had procured Martius to make these warres, to be revenged of
them: bicause it pleased them to see their goodes burnt and spoyled
before their eyes, whilest them selves were well at ease, and dyd
behold the peoples losses and misfortunes, and knowing their owne
goods safe and out of daunger: and howe the warre was not made against
the noble men, that had the enemie abroad, to keepe that they had in safety.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In Shakespeare there is no word of Coriolanus
making any such distinction either from policy or partisanship: he is
incensed against all the inhabitants of Rome, “the dastard nobles”
quite as much as the offending plebeians. And, on the other hand,
though the patricians revile the populace and its leaders, there is no
division between the orders, and they show no inclination to disregard
the solidarity of their interests. This contrast becomes more marked in
the sequel. According to Plutarch, the people in panic desire to recall
the exile; but the</p>

<p class="blockquot">Senate assembled upon it, would in no case yeld to
that. Who either dyd it of a selfe will to be contrarie to the peoples
desire: or bicause Martius should not returne through the grace and
favour of the people.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Afterwards, however, when he encamps so near Rome,
the majority has its way:</p>

<p class="blockquot">For there was no Consul, Senatour, nor Magistrate,
that durst once contrarie the opinion of the people, for the calling
home againe of Martius.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Accordingly, the first envoys are instructed to
announce to him his re-instatement in all his rights.</p>

<p>In Shakespeare’s account the action of Rome becomes much more
dignified. In none of the negociations, in no chance word of citizen,
tribune or senator, is there any hint of the sentence on Coriolanus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span>
being revoked. Only when peace is concluded does his recall follow
quite naturally, as an act of gratitude, in the burst of jubilant relief:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Unshout the shout that banish’d Marcius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Repeal him with the welcome of his mother.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> v. 4.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This, too, is one of the indications of Shakespeare’s feeling for Roman
greatness, that we should bear in mind when elsewhere he seems to show
less sense even than Plutarch of her civic virtue.</p>

<p>The last notable deviation of the play from the biography occurs in the
passage which deals with the murder of Coriolanus, and the difference
is such as to make the victim far more responsible for the crime.</p>

<p>In Plutarch, after his return to Antium, Tullus, wishing to make away
with him, demands that he should be deposed from his authority and
taken to task. Marcius replies that he is willing to resign, if this
be required by all the lords, and also to give account to the people
if they will hear him. Thereupon a common council is called, at which
proceedings begin by certain orators inciting popular feeling against him.</p>

<p class="blockquot">When they had tolde their tales, Martius rose up
to make them aunswer. Now, notwithstanding the mutinous people made a
marvelous great noyse, yet when they sawe him, for the reverence they
bare unto his valliantnes, they quieted them selves, and gave still
audience to alledge with leysure what he could for his purgation.
Moreover, the honestest men of the Antiates, and who most rejoyced
in peace, shewed by their countenaunce that they would heare him
willingly, and judge also according to their conscience. Whereupon
Tullus fearing that if he dyd let him speake, he would prove his
innocencie to the people, bicause emongest other things he had an
eloquent tongue, besides that the first good service he had done to
the people of the Volsces, dyd winne him more favour, then these last
accusations could purchase him displeasure: and furthermore, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span>
offence they layed to his charge, was a testimonie of the good will
they ought him, for they would never have thought he had done them
wrong for that they tooke not the cittie of Rome, if they had not bene
very neare taking of it, by meanes of his approche and conduction. For
these causes Tullus thought he might no lenger delaye his pretence and
enterprise, neither to tarie for the mutining and rising of the common
people against him: wherefore those that were of the conspiracie,
beganne to crie out that he was not to be heard, nor that they would
not suffer a traytour to usurpe tyrannicall power over the tribe of the
Volsces, who would not yeld up his estate and authoritie. And in saying
these wordes, they all fell upon him, and killed him in the market
place, none of the people once offering to rescue him. Howbeit it is a
clear case, that this murder was not generally consented unto, of the
most parte of the Volsces: for men came out of all partes to honour his
bodie, and dyd honorablie burie him, setting out his tombe with great
store of armour and spoyles, as the tombe of a worthie persone and
great captaine.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Here the conspirators do not give him a chance,
but kill him before a word passes his lips. In the tragedy, on the
contrary, all might have been well, if in his rage of offended pride
at Tullus’ insults and taunts, he had not been carried away with his
vaunts and reminders to excite and excuse the passions of his hearers.
And thus with Shakespeare his ungovernable insolence is now made the
cause of his death, just as before it has been accentuated as the cause
of his banishment.</p>

<p>Still, though the exasperation against Coriolanus in Rome as in Corioli
is thus in a measure justified, his own violence also receives its
apology. In the latter case it is the provocation of Aufidius that
rouses him to frenzy. In the former, it is the ineptitude of the
citizens that fills him with scorn for their claims. And it is with
reference to this and his whole conception of the Roman plebs that
Shakespeare has made the most momentous and remarkable change in his
story, the consideration of which we have purposely left to the last.
The discussion of the difference in Plutarch’s and in Shakespeare’s
attitude to the people will show us some of the most important aspects
of the play.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE GRAND CONTRAST.<br />SHAKESPEARE’S CONCEPTION<br />
OF THE SITUATION IN ROME</span></h3>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to describe with any certainty the reasons for
Shakespeare’s variations from Plutarch in his treatment of the people.
They may, like some of those already discussed, be due to the dramatic
requirement of compression. They may be due to the deliberate purpose
of exonerating the hero. They may, and this is more likely, have arisen
quite naturally and unconsciously from Shakespeare’s indifference to
questions of constitutional theory and his inability to understand the
ideals of an antique self-governing commonwealth controlled by all
its free members as a body. In any case the result is a picture of
the primitive society, from which some of Plutarch’s inconsistencies,
but with them some of the most typical traits, have been removed. The
grand characteristic which the Tudor Englishman rejects, or all but
rejects, is the intuitive political capacity which Plutarch, perhaps
in idealising retrospect, attributes to all classes of citizens in the
young republic, and which at any rate in after development formed the
distinctive genius of the Roman state. He has indeed an inarticulate
sense of it that enables him to suggest the general impression. He
could not but have a sense of it; for few men have been so pentrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>
with the greatness of later Rome as he, and he seems to have felt, as
the shapers of the tradition and as Plutarch felt, that such a tree
must have sprung from a healthy seed. So when we examine what his story
involves, we have evidence enough of a general spirit of moderation,
accommodation, compromise, that flow from and minister to an efficient
practical patriotism; an ingrafted love of the city; and a conviction
of the community of interests among high and low alike. Mr. Watkiss
Lloyd puts this with great emphasis, and on the whole with great truth.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Rome is preserved from cleaving in the midst by
the virtues of the state, the reverence for the political majority
which pervades both contending parties. The senate averts the last evil
by the timely concession of the tribunitian power first, and then by
sacrifice of a favourite champion of their own order, rather than civil
war shall break out and all go to ruin in quarrel for the privilege and
supremacy of a part. Rather than this they will concede, and trust to
temporising, to negociating, to management, to the material influence
of their position and the effect of their own merits and achievements,
to secure their power or recover it hereafter. Among the people, on
the other hand, there is also a restraining sentiment, a religion that
holds back from the worst abuses of successful insurrection and excited
faction. The proposition to kill Marcius is easily given up. Even the
tribunes are capable of being persuaded to forego the extremity of
rancour against the enemy of the people and of their authority, when
he is fairly in their power, and commute death for banishment; and,
the victory achieved, they counsel tranquility, as Menenius, on the
other hand, softens down; and all goes smoothly again like a reconciled
household, after experience of the miseries of adjusting wrongs by
debate and anger.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Similarly the interests of the country are supreme
when Coriolanus, with his new allies, advances to the attack:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Some impatience of the people against the tribunes
is natural, but the tribunes with all their faults, take their
humiliation not ignobly, and the nobles never for a moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
dream of getting a party triumph by foreign aid. The danger of the
country engrosses all, and at last Volumnia presses upon her son the
right and the noble, and employs all the influences of domestic and
natural affection—but all entirely to the great political and national
end,—and is as disregardful of the fortunes or interests of the
aristocratical party, which might have hoped to seize the opportunity
for recovering lost ground, as she is apparently unaware, unconscious,
regardless of what may be the consequences personally to her much loved son.</p>

<p class="no-indent">And Mr. Lloyd clinches his plea by his estimate of
the catastrophe.</p>

<p class="blockquot">In the concluding scene we appear to see the
supremacy of Rome assured.... In the senate house of the Volscians
is perpetrated the assassination, from the disgrace of which the
better spirit of the Romans preserved their city: Aufidius and his
fellows with equal envy and ingratitude take the place of the plotting
tribunes, and the senators are powerless to control the conspirators
and mob of citizens who abet them.</p>

<p class="no-indent">They are, in short, in comparison with Rome
self-condemned; and this becomes more manifest if we contrast the
finale of the play with the concluding sentences in Plutarch, which
Shakespeare leaves unused.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now Martius being dead, the whole state of the
Volsces hartely wished him alive again. For first of all they fell out
with the Æques (who were their friendes and confederates) touching
preheminence and place: and this quarrell grew on so farre betwene
them, and frayes and murders fell out apon it one with another. After
that, the Romaines overcame them in battell, in which Tullus was
slaine in the field, and the flower of all their force was put to the
sworde: so that they were compelled to accept most shameful conditions
of peace, in yelding them selves subject unto the conquerors, and
promising to be obedient at their commandement.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It is at first sight rather strange that
Shakespeare should give no indication that the Volscians, first by
condoning Tullus’ crime, the breach of friendship from desire for
pre-eminence, then by repeating it as a community, prepare the way for
their own downfall. Perhaps he felt that no finger-post was necessary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
and that all must see how in the long
run such a state must inevitably succumb to the greater moral force of
Rome.</p>

<p>A few slight qualifications would have to be made in Mr. Lloyd’s
statement of his thesis to render it absolutely correct, but it is
true in the main. Nevertheless, true though it be, it makes no account
of two very important considerations. One of these is that despite
the general appreciation which Shakespeare shows for the attitude of
the Roman <i>Civitas</i>, he has no perception of the real issues
between the plebeians and the patricians, or of the course which the
controversy took, though these matters constitute the chief claim of
the citizens of early Rome to the credit they receive in Plutarch’s
narrative. And the other consideration is, that Shakespeare’s general
appreciation of the community he describes is perceptible only when we
view the play at a distance and in its mass: the impression in detail
as we follow it from scene to scene is by no means so favourable to
either party.</p>

<p>The first point is well brought out by the total omission in the drama
of the initial episode in the discussion between the populace and the
senate, and between the populace and Marcius. And the omission is all
the more noticeable since Plutarch gives it particular prominence as
directly leading to the establishment of the tribunate, which the
drama, as we shall see, ascribes merely to an insignificant bread
riot. Here is what Shakespeare must have read, and what slips from him
without leaving more than a trace, though to modern feeling it is one
of the most impressive passages in the whole <i>Life</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now (Martius) being growen to great credit and
authoritie in Rome for his valliantnes, it fortuned there grewe
sedition in the cittie, bicause the Senate dyd favour the riche against
the people, who dyd complaine of the sore oppression of userers, of
whom they borowed money. For those that had litle, were yet spoyled of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span>
that litle they had by their creditours, for lack of abilitie to paye
the userie: who offered their goodes to be solde, to them that would
geve most. And suche as had nothing left, their bodies were layed
holde of, and they were made their bonde men, notwithstanding all
the woundes and cuttes they shewed, which they had receyved in many
battells, fighting for defence of their countrie and common wealth: of
the which, the last warre they made, was against the Sabynes, wherein
they fought apon the promise the riche men had made them, that from
thenceforth they would intreate them more gently, and also upon the
worde of Marcus Valerius chief of the Senate, who by authoritie of the
counsell, and in the behalfe of the riche, sayed they should performe
that they had promised. But after that they had faithfully served in
this last battell of all, where they overcame their enemies, seeing
they were never a whit the better, nor more gently intreated, and that
the Senate would geve no eare to them, but make as though they had
forgotten their former promise, and suffered them to be made slaves and
bonde men to their creditours, and besides, to be turned out of all
that ever they had; they fell then even to flat rebellion and mutinie,
and to sturre up daungerous tumultes within the cittie. The Romaines
enemies, hearing of this rebellion, dyd straight enter the territories
of Rome with a marvelous great power, spoyling and burning all as
they came. Whereupon the Senate immediatly made open proclamation by
sounde of trumpet, that all those which were of lawfull age to carie
weapon, should come and enter their names into the muster masters
booke, to goe to the warres: but no man obeyed their commaundement.
Whereupon their chief magistrates, and many of the Senate, beganne
to be of divers opinions emong them selves. For some thought it was
reason, they should somewhat yeld to the poore peoples request, and
that they should a little qualifie the severitie of the lawe. Other
held hard against that opinion, and that was Martius for one. For he
alleaged, that the creditours losing their money they had lent, was
not the worst thing that was thereby: but that the lenitie that was
favored, was a beginning of disobedience, and that the prowde attempt
of the communaltie, was to abolish lawe, and to bring all to confusion.
Therefore he sayed; if the Senate were wise, they should betimes
prevent, and quenche this ill favored and worse ment beginning. The
Senate met many dayes in consultation about it: but in the end they
concluded nothing. The poore common people seeing no redresse, gathered
them selves one daye together, and one encoraging another, they all
forsooke the cittie, and encamped them selves upon a hill, called at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span>
this daye the holy hill, alongest the river of Tyber, offering no
creature any hurte or violence, or making any shewe of actuall
rebellion; saving that they cried as they went up and down, that the
riche men had driven them out of the cittie, and that all Italie
through they should finde ayer, water and ground to burie them in.
Moreover, they sayed, to dwell at Rome was nothing els but to be
slaine, or hurte with continuell warres and fighting for defence of the
riche mens goodes.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Plutarch goes on to tell how in this crisis
the Senate adopts a conciliatory attitude, and how after the fable
of Menenius, the mutineers are pacified by the concession of five
<i>Tribuni plebis</i>, “whose office should be to defend the poore
people from violence and oppression.” Then he concludes this part of
his recital:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Hereupon the cittie being growen againe to good
quiet and unitie, the people immediatly went to the warres, shewing
that they had a good will to doe better than ever they dyd, and to
be very willing to obey the magistrates in that they would commaund
concerning the warres.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Now, in this account there is no question which
side is on the right and has a claim on our sympathies. The plebs is
reduced to distress by fighting for the state and for the aristocratic
<i>régime</i> that was set up some twenty years before: its misery is
aggravated by harsh and inadequate laws, the redress of which it seeks
by a policy of passive resistance; its demands are so equitable that
they are approved by a portion of the Senate, and so urgent that they
are conceded by the Senate as a whole: but such is the strength of
class selfishness, that when the hour of need is past, the patricians
violate their explicit promise, and the grievances become more
intolerable than before. Even now the plebeians break out in no violent
rebellion, and hardly show their discontent in a casual riot. In their
worst desperation they merely secede, and in their very secession they
are far from stubborn. They admit Menenius’ moral that the Senate has
an essential function in the state: and as a preliminary to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
return, only stipulate for a machinery that will protect them against
further oppression.</p>

<p>But hardly a line in the description of this movement which the
plebeians conducted so moderately and sagaciously to a successful
end, has passed into the picture of Shakespeare. He ignores the
reasonableness of their cause, the reasonableness of their means,
and fails to perceive the essential efficiency and steadiness of
their character, though all these things are expressed or implied in
Plutarch’s narrative. This episode, in which the younger contemporary
of Nero favours the people, the elder contemporary of Pym summarily
dismisses, and substitutes for it another far less important, in which
they appear in no very creditable light, but which had nothing to do
with the institution of the Tribunate, and occurred in consequence of
the dearth only after the capture of Corioli.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Now when this warre was ended, the flatterers
of the people beganne to sturre up sedition againe, without any newe
occasion, or just matter offered of complainte. For they dyd grounde
this seconde insurrection against the Nobilitie and Patricians, apon
the people’s miserie and misfortune, that could not but fall out, by
reason of the former discorde and sedition, betweene them and the
Nobilitie. Bicause the most parte of the errable land within the
territorie of Rome, was become heathie and barren for lacke of plowing,
for that they had no time nor meane to cause corne, to be brought them
out of other countries to sowe, by reason of their warres which made
the extreme dearth they had emong them. Now those busie pratlers that
sought the peoples good will, by suche flattering wordes, perceyving
great scarsitie of corne to be within the cittie, and though there had
bene plenty enough, yet the common people had no money to buye it:
they spread abroad false tales and rumours against the Nobilitie, that
they in revenge of the people, had practised and procured the extreme
dearthe emong them.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This circumstance, combined with the still later
demand for a distribution of corn, Shakespeare transposes, and makes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>
the surely rather inappropriate cause of the appointment of the
tribunes. Inappropriate, that is, to what the logic of the situation
requires, and to what the sagacity of the traditional plebs would
solicit. They ask for bread and they get a magistrate. But not
inappropriate to the unreasoning demands of a frenzied proletariat.
Many parallels might be cited from the French revolutions. But this
is just an instance of Shakespeare’s inability to conceive a popular
rising in other terms than the outbreak of a mob.</p>

<p>And this leads us to the second point. The general moderation
and dignity implied in the attitude of Rome, viewed broadly and
comprehensively, almost disappears when we are confronted with the full
concrete life of the participants in all its picturesque and incisive
details.</p>

<p>For consider first a little more closely the treatment of the
people. We have seen that in many ways the proceedings which it and
its representatives take against Coriolanus are more defensible in
Shakespeare than in Plutarch: but, on the other hand, they have less
rational grounds for the original insurrection, and are much less
clear-sighted and consequent in choosing the means of redress. They are
comparatively well-meaning and fair, neither bitter nor narrow-minded,
but they are quite inefficient, far from self-reliant, very childish
and helpless. They are conspicuously lacking in political aptitude,
but they make up for it by a certain soundness of feeling. Plutarch’s
plebeians go the right way about protecting themselves from unjust
laws, but they pursue Coriolanus with rancorous chicane even when
his policy has been overturned. Shakespeare’s plebeians seek to
legislate against a natural calamity, but at the crisis they turn quite
justifiably, if a little tardily, on a would-be governor who makes no
secret of his ill-will. Taken as separate units, they may be unwashed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span>
and puzzle-headed, but they are worthy fellows whom misery has driven
desperate, yet whose misery claims compassion, though their desperation
makes them meddle in things too high for them. In the opening scene,
the First Citizen, even when calling for the death of Marcius, does so
merely because he imagines that it is the preliminary to getting cheap food:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in
thirst for revenge.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 15.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">But even among the maddened and famishing crowd,
Marcius is not without his advocate. The Second Citizen admonishes
them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 30.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And though these the ringleader discounts on the ground that they were
due not to patriotism, but to personal pride and filial affection,
his apologist, persisting in his defence, points out that he is not
responsible for his inborn tendencies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice in him.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 42.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">All this is candid enough: a benevolent neutral could not say more.
These rioters have no thought of libelling their adversary. They deny
neither his claims nor his merits; they only assert that these are
outweighed by his offences. The Second Citizen proceeds in his plea:</p>

<p class="blockquot">You must in no way say he is covetous;</p>

<p class="no-indent">and the First rejoins:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath
faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 43.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">We have seen how Shakespeare adopts from Plutarch
the motive for the plebeians’ initial support of Coriolanus at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
election, but he makes it a more striking instance of their fairness,
for he represents them as quite aware and mindful of the reasons on the
other side.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Fourth Citizen.</i> You have deserved nobly of your country, and
you have not deserved nobly.</p>
<p><i>Coriolanus.</i> Your enigma?</p>
<p><i>Fourth Citizen.</i> You have been a scourge to her enemies, you
have been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved the common people.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 94.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is all very well for the candidate to turn this
off with a flout, but it is the sober truth. That the despised plebeian
should see both sides of the case shows in him more sanity of judgment
than Coriolanus ever possessed: that he should nevertheless cast his
vote for such an applicant shows more generosity as well. And the
generosity, if also the simplicity, of the electors is likewise made
more pronounced than in Plutarch by their persevering in their course
despite the scorn with which Coriolanus treats them; of which Plutarch
of course knows nothing. Even that they forgive till the tribunes
irritate the wounds and predict more fatal ones from the new weapon
that has been put into such ruthless hands.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Did you perceive</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 207.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>All these instances of right feeling and instinctive appreciation of
greatness are in Shakespeare’s picture, while they are either not at
all or in a much less degree in Plutarch’s. And these citizens are
capable of following good leadership as well as bad. They listen to
Menenius, and are “almost persuaded” by his argument, without, as in
Plutarch, making their acceptance of it merely provisional. Under
Cominius they quit themselves, as he says, “like Romans,” and he gives
them the praise:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Breathe you, my friends: well fought.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> vi. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>
Afterwards too he recognises that they are earning their share of the
spoil, even as before they had borne themselves stoutly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">March on, my fellows:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Make good this ostentation, and you shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Divide in all with us.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> vi. 85.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is said to the volunteers who come forward
at Marcius’ summons, an episode for which there is hardly a hint in
Plutarch. There, indeed, we read that he cannot call off the looters
from the treasures of Corioli:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Whereupon taking those that willingly offered
them selves he went out of the cittie:</p>

<p class="no-indent">which supplies the sentence,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">I, with those that have the spirit, will haste</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To help Cominius.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> v. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But this hint, if hint it were, Shakespeare
uses anew with far stronger and brighter colouring in the incident
of Marcius’ stirring appeal to Cominius’ men and their enthusiastic
response: which is to be found only in the drama:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">If any such be here—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As it were sin to doubt—that love this painting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein you see me smear’d: if any fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lesser his person than an ill report;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If any think brave death outweighs bad life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that his country’s dearer than himself;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let him alone, or so many so minded,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wave thus, to express his disposition,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And follow Marcius.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">[<i>They all shout and wave their swords, take him</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent4"><i>up in their arms, and cast up their caps.</i>]</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> vi. 67.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">If they are handled in the right way, these
citizen soldiers can play their part well. But they need to be
rightly handled, they need to have their feelings stirred. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span>
have no rational initiative of their own, and cannot do without
inspiration and guidance. For, consider the grounds for their rising.
Shakespeare not only completely suppresses the remarkable secession to
the Mons Sacer, but barely mentions the social grievances that led to
it. The First Citizen says indeed of the patricians:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>[They] make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily any
wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing
statutes daily, to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us
not up, they will.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 83.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">But this is a mere passing remark, and no stress
is laid on these, the real causes of the discontent, in comparison with
the dearth, which for the rest seems to end with the Coriolan campaign,
when there is, as Cominius promises, a “common distribution” of the
spoils. Now the dearth is represented as a mere disastrous accident,
for which no one is responsible, and for which there is no remedy save
prayer—or such a foray as presently took place. Menenius expressly says so:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent19">For the dearth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gods, not the patricians, made it, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your knees to them, not arms, must help.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 74.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is alleged, no doubt, by the mutineers that the
“storehouses are crammed with grain,” but there is no confirmation of
this in the play, and the way in which “honest” Menenius reports the
rumour, and Marcius, who is never less than honest receives it, implies
that it is mere tittle tattle and gossip of the chimney corner.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Marcius.</i><span class="ws7">What’s their seeking?</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Menenius.</i> For corn at their own rates: whereof, they say,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Marcius.</i><span class="ws7">Hang ’em!</span>&emsp; They say!</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And feebling such as stand not in their liking</div>

    <div class="verse indent38">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 192.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</span>
In short their temper is hardly parodied in the modern skit,</p>

<p class="blockquot">Who fills the butchers’ shops with large blue flies?</p>

<p class="no-indent">And if they resemble the ignorant fanatics
of later days in the unreasonableness of their complaints, they
resemble them too, as we have seen, in the unreasonableness of
their remedies. If things were as the play implies what help would
lie in constitutional reform? They are no better than the starving
<i>Sansculottes</i> who sought to allay their hunger by snatching new
morsels of the royal prerogative. It really reads like a scene in
Carlyle’s Paris of 1790 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, and not like
any scene in Plutarch’s Rome of 494 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
when Coriolanus describes the delight of the famine-stricken crowds at
getting their representatives:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">They threw their caps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As they would hang them on the horns o’ the moon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shouting their emulation.</div>
    <div class="verse indent33">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 216.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Moreover, when left to themselves, or when their sleeping manhood is
not awakened, these plebeians, otherwise than those of Plutarch, have
not even the average of physical courage. They can fight creditably
under the competent management of Cominius, or heroically under the
stimulus of Marcius’ rousing appeal: but if such influences are
lacking, they fail. Menenius says of them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Though abundantly they lack discretion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet are they passing cowardly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 206.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Marcius ironically invites them to the wars by
indicating what would be, and turns out to be, provision for their needs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Volsces have much corn: take these rats thither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutineers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent33">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 253.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span>
And the citizens steal away. In truth the low opinion of their mettle
seems justified by events. At Corioli the troops under Cominius do
well, but those in Marcius’ division, perhaps because his treatment
does not call out what is best in them, seem to deserve a part at least
of his imprecations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All the contagion of the south light on you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You shames of Rome! You herd of——.&emsp;Boils and plagues</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Further than seen, and one infect another</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iv. 30.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Nor do they appear in a better light in the
moment of partial victory, for they at once fall to plunder instead
of following it up and helping their fellows. This touch, of course,
Shakespeare derived from Plutarch.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The most parte of the souldiers beganne
incontinently to spoyle, to carie awaye, and to looke up the bootie
they had wonne. But Martius was marvelous angry with them, and cried
out on them, that it was no time now to looke after spoyle, and to
ronne straggling here and there to enriche them selves, whilest the
other Consul and their fellowe cittizens peradventure were fighting
with their enemies; and howe that leaving the spoyle they should seeke
to winde them selves out of daunger and perill. Howbeit, crie, and saye
to them what he could, very fewe of them would hearken to him.</p>

<p class="no-indent">But Shakespeare is not content with this. He quite
without warrant describes the articles as worthless, to emphasise the
baseness of the pillagers.</p>

<p>What then is Shakespeare’s opinion of the people as a whole? Despite
his sympathy with those of whom it is composed, it is to him a
giant not yet in his teens, with formidable physical strength, with
crude natural impulses to the good and the bad, kindly-natured and
simple-minded, not incapable of fair-dealing and generosity; but rude,
blundering, untaught, and therefore subject to spasms of fury, panic,
and greed, fit for useful service only when it finds the right leader,
but sure to go wrong if abandoned to its own or evil guidance.</p>

<p>To the danger of evil guidance, however, it is specially exposed, for
it loves flattery and is imposed on by professions of goodwill: so
Shakespeare reserves his severest treatment for those who cajole it,
the demagogues of the Tribunate. No doubt in his tolerant objective way
he concedes even to them a measure of justification. He was bound to do
so, else they would have been outside the pale of dramatic sympathy;
and also the culpability of Coriolanus would have been obscured. So
there is something to be said even for their policy and management.
They are quite right in fearing the results of Coriolanus’ elevation to
the chief place in Rome:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

Their admonitions to the electors are such as the organisers of a party
are not only entitled but bound to give to a constituency:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Could you not have told him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As you were lesson’d, when he had no power,</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 180.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">These forebodings of what is likely to occur are
not only thoroughly justifiable but obvious.</p>

<p>Then, though their abandonment of the methods of violence and
acceptance of a trial are discounted partly by the perils of open
force, partly by their confidence in and manipulation of a verdict to
their minds, their willingness to substitute the penalty of banishment
for the extreme sentence of death, must stand, as we have seen, to the
credit, if not of their placability, at least of their moderation and
prudence. Moreover, if we could disregard the dangers of war, their
“platform,” as we should now call it, seems approved by its success.
One cannot but sympathise with the satisfaction of Sicinius at the
results of Marcius’ expulsion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">We hear not of him, neither need we fear him:</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 1.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And when the citizens pass with their greetings,
the tribune has a right to say to Menenius:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This is a happier and more comely time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than when these fellows ran about the streets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crying confusion.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 27.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Even Menenius has to give a modified and grudging
approval of the new position of things:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All’s well: and might have been much better, if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He could have temporised.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 16.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And when the disastrous news comes in, after the
first outburst of incredulous wrath and terrified impatience, the two
colleagues bear themselves well enough. There is shrewdness and good
sense in Sicinius’ words to the citizens:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Go, masters, get you home: be not dismay’d;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These are a side that would be glad to have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And show no sign of fear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 149.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When this very natural and probable conjecture
proves false, they both rise to the occasion, or seek to do so, the
cross-grained Sicinius somewhat more effectually than the glib-tongued
Brutus, and show a certain dignity and justness of feeling. Their
remonstrance with and petition to Menenius, if we grant the patriotism
on the one side as well as the other, are not without their cogency:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this so never-needed help, yet do not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upbraid’s with our distress.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 33.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When Menenius objects that his mission will be
futile, Sicinius’ reply comes near being noble:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Yet your good will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As you intended well.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 45).</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When Menenius, returning from his fruitless
mission, describes Coriolanus in his unapproachable, inexorable power,
the tribune’s rejoinder is again the true one:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Menenius.</i> He wants nothing of a god but eternity and
a heaven to throne in.</p>
<p><i>Sicinius.</i> Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv. 24.)</p>
</div>

<p>Yet these various traits so little interfere with the general
impression, that perhaps many tolerably careful readers who are
familiar with the play, hardly take them into account. In the total
effect they both seem to us pitiful busybodies, whose ill-earned
influence only leads to disaster; or, as Menenius describes them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A pair of tribunes that have rack’d for Rome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To make coals cheap.</div>
    <div class="verse indent29">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 16.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="space-below1">The first feature we notice in them is their
pride, a vice which they blame in Coriolanus, and with which their
own is expressly contrasted. For his is the haughty, unbending
self-consciousness that is based on the sense of indwelling force, and
has a shrinking disgust for praise. Theirs, on the other hand, revels
in popularity, and their power depends entirely on the support which
that popularity secures them. As Menenius tells them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>You are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 76.)</p>

<p>Your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
single: your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 39.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">They are really consequential and overweening
rather than proud. And magnifying their importance and their office,
they are apt to take too seriously any trifle in which they are
concerned, and to become irritated at any mishap to their own
convenience. Having no standard but themselves by which to measure the
proportion of things, they are fussy over minor points and lose their
tempers over petty troubles. This is the point of Menenius’ banter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between
an orange-wife and a fosset-seller; and then rejourn the controversy
of three pence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chanced to be pinched with the
colic, you make faces like mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy
bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing: all the peace you make in
their cause is, calling both the parties knaves.</p>

<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 77.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This is, they are disposed to treat a molehill
as a mountain, but if they are galled, to break out in indiscriminate and
unjustified abuse. Menenius gives it them home in respect of these foibles:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>You talk of pride: O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes
of your necks, and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O
that you could!</p>
<p><i>Brutus.</i> What then, sir?</p>
<p><i>Menenius.</i> Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 41.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">This is the utterance of an enemy; nevertheless it
is confirmed by their behaviour, and is moreover a prophecy of their
action in regard to Marcius. In the first place their pride has been
insulted by his:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Sicinius.</i> Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Brutus.</i> He has no equal.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Sicinius.</i> When we were chosen tribunes of the people,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Brutus.</i> Mark’d you his lip and eyes?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Sicinius.</i><span class="ws8">Nay, but his taunts.</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Brutus.</i> Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Sicinius.</i> Bemock the modest moon.</div>
    <div class="verse indent36">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 256.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">A man who gibes at the gods, the moon, and above
all the tribunes, is evidently a profane and irreverent fellow who
should be got rid of. And perhaps it is anxiety not only for the public
good but for their own authority that makes them dread their office
may “go sleep,” during his consulship. At any rate the disrespect with
which they have been treated is one main motive of their indignation:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span>
“<i>Our</i> Aediles smote, <i>ourselves</i> resisted!” they exclaim in
pardonable horror (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> i. 319).</p>

<p>Then the means they take to ruin Coriolanus, though not without its
astuteness, and similar enough to what is practised every day in
parliamentary tactics, is altogether base: it is the device of mean,
paltry, inferior natures. They speculate on the defect of their enemy’s
greatness, they reckon on his heroic vehemence and forcefulness to
destroy him, and lay plans to betray his nobility to a passion that
will embroil him with the people. It is as easy, says Sicinius, to
drive him to provocation “as to set dogs on sheep” (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i.
273). But easy though it is, they are careful to give minute directions
to their gang. Sicinius tells them that any condition proposed to him,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">Would have gall’d his surly nature,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which easily endures not article</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You should have ta’en the advantage of his choler</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And pass’d him unelected.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 203.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Then, after engineering the disavowal of the
elected candidate, Brutus calculates</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If, as his nature is, he fall in rage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With their refusal, both observe and answer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The vantage of his anger.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 266.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And here are his final instructions for the
behaviour of the people at the trial:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Put him to choler straight: he hath been used</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ever to conquer, and to have his worth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be rein’d again to temperance; then he speaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What’s in his heart; and that is there which looks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To break his neck.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 25.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The suggestion for these proceedings comes, as we saw, from Plutarch;
but in this one respect his tribunes are by no means so wily. They
contrive a dilemma in which Coriolanus will have either to humble or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>
compromise himself; but though they would prefer the latter
alternative, they do nothing to bring it about.</p>

<p>Yet with all their activity in the matter, they are meanly desirous of
evading responsibility and saving their own skins.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Brutus.</i><span class="ws7">Lay</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A fault on us, your tribunes; that we labour’d,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Sicinius.</i><span class="ws3">Say you chose him</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More after our commandment than as guided</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> iii. 234.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And parallel with this is the crowning vulgarity
of their triumph:</p>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> iii. 138.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is perhaps the supreme instance of their
headstrong, testy and inconsiderate violence, for, as we shall see,
it embitters the wavering Marcius and drives him to alliance with the
foe. But the same violence has abundantly appeared before. The rest
do all in their power to appease the tumult and procure a hearing for
Sicinius, he uses the opportunity to add fuel to the fire and deserves
Menenius’ rebuke:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the way to kindle, not to quench.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 197.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When Brutus proceeds in the same way, Cominius
interrupts:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That is the way to lay the city flat;</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span>
Menenius has to admonish them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With modest warrant.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 274.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">One word more, one word.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tie leaden pounds to’s heels.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 311.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">They do yield at last, but clearly the game they
were playing in unreflecting impatience was most hazardous for the
populace itself. Indeed, even when they have accepted more moderate
counsels, the expulsion of Coriolanus seems an act not only of
ingratitude but of recklessness. Their low cunning has attained an
end, good perhaps in itself for the party they represent, but even for
that party of insignificant advantage in view of the wider issues.
Volumnia’s taunt is very much to the point:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent19">Hadst thou foxship</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To banish him that struck more blows for Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than thou hast spoken words?</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> ii. 18.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">For after all, the pressing need in that period
of constant war, as Plutarch and Shakespeare imagine it, was defence
of the whole state, the plebs as well as the senate, against the
foreign enemy, and the danger of an invasion was one of the ordinary
probabilities of the case. Most men who had any sense of proportion
would, in the circumstances, pause before they banished the sword and
soldiership of Rome. No doubt the tribunes were to be excused for not
foreseeing the renegacy of Coriolanus; when it is announced as a fact
Menenius can hardly credit it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">This is unlikely:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He and Aufidius can no more atone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than violentest contrariety.</div>
    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 71.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span>
It is less excusable that they should neglect the danger of a new
attack from the Volsces, for though Cominius, as we saw, makes a
similar error, he does so when Marcius is still on the side of the
Romans. Menenius’ exclamation, when the invasion actually takes
place and when the news of it is first brought to Rome, describes a
situation, the possibility or probability of which every public man
should have anticipated.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">’Tis Aufidius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who, hearing of our Marcius’ banishment,</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 42.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This, though of course an understatement, for in
point of fact Aufidius did not wait for Marcius’ banishment, is at
any rate the least that was to be expected. But the tribunes, with a
sanguine and criminal shortsightedness that suggests a distinguished
pair of British politicians in our own day, refuse to admit as
conceivable a fact the likelihood of which the circumstances of the
case and recent experience avouch.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="no-indent">Besides, the Volscians were not the only jealous
neighbours the young republic had to guard herself against.</p>

<p>But their reception of the unwelcome tidings is a new instance of the
ignoble strain in the tribunes’ nature. The first effect they have on
Brutus is to enrage him against the informant: “Go see this rumourer
whipp’d”; and Sicinius seconds the humane direction, but improves on it

that the public may be duly cautioned against telling unpalatable
truths: “Go whip him ’fore the people’s eyes.” Menenius may well
remonstrate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">Reason with the fellow,</div>

    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 51.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is not merely an illustration of their
habitual touchiness and irritability at whatever thwarts them.
Once more we think of the words of the messenger in <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i> when he fears to report the worst: “The nature of bad
news infects the teller”; and of Antony’s reply: “When it concerns the
fool and coward.” There is beyond doubt more than a spice of folly
and cowardice in the self-important quidnuncs, with their purblind
temerity and shifty meanness. We are very glad to hear in the end of
Brutus being mishandled by the mob and very sorry that Sicinius goes
free: but at least he has had his dose of alarm and mortification,
and in the future his influence will be gone; which is well. Yet they
are not bad men. They are very like the majority of the citizens of
Great and Greater Britain, and no inconsiderable portion of those
who govern the Empire and its members. They have a certain amount of
principle, shrewdness, and, if the test of misfortune comes, even of
proper feeling. They would have made very worthy aldermen of a small
municipality. But measured against the greatness of Rome, or even of
Coriolanus, they are as gnats to the lion.</p>

<p>The picture, then, of the people and its elect is not flattering if
we follow it in detail, but a similar examination is hardly more
favourable to the nobles. Of course their behaviour is to a certain
extent accounted for by the peculiarity of their position. Hitherto,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>
since the expulsion of the kings, the “honoured number” have had
it all their own way in the state, and Shakespeare imputes no blame
to their management, unless it be their excessive arrogance towards
the populace they rule and employ. But now bad times have made that
populace seditious, and they have discovered that, rightly or wrongly,
they must give it a share of the power. Their pride, their traditions,
the consciousness of their faculty for government, pull them one
way, the necessities of the case pull them another. A dominant caste
is placed in a false position when it is forced to capitulate to
assailants for whom it feels an unreasonable contempt and a reasonable
mistrust. When we consider the difficulties of the situation and the
broad results, the patricians, as we saw, come off respectably enough,
and we must give them credit for circumspection, adaptability, and
civic cohesion. But in detail their attitude betrays the uncertainty
and weakness that cannot but ensue in a man or a body of men when
there is a conflict between conviction and expediency, and an attempt
to obey them both. Their scorn of the plebeians, followed by the
very brief effort for their champion and very prompt acquiescence in
his expatriation, makes an unpleasant impression; and this is more
noticeable in the drama than in the biography. Plutarch repeatedly
states that they disagree among themselves, many of them sympathising
with the popular demands and only the younger men favouring the harsh
and reactionary views of Coriolanus.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
This distinction has left no trace in the play except in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>
stage-direction which represents him as departing into exile escorted
to the gates by his friends, his relatives, and “the young nobility
of Rome”: but otherwise Shakespeare makes no use of it. Coriolanus
is mouthpiece for the ideals not of heedless youth but of all the
aristocracy, though most of them may be more politic than he and not so
frank. Nevertheless his presuppositions are theirs, and therefore they
seem temporisers and poltroons beside their outspoken advocate. Indeed,
through Menenius, they admit they have been to blame:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent15">We loved him; but, like beasts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who did hoot him out o’ the city.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 121.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Nor do they act very vigorously when destruction threatens Rome. They
do not indeed seek to separate their cause from that of the whole
community and make terms with their former friend for their own class.
Beyond some naturally bitter gibes at the “clusters” and their leaders,
not unaccompanied for the rest by bitter outbursts against themselves,
there is no trace of the dissensions with the people which Plutarch
describes. But they have no thought of organising any attempt at
resistance. True, there are circumstances in Shakespeare that account
for this supineness as it is not explained in his authority. It is
partly due to the feeling that they are in the wrong, which Shakespeare
in a much greater degree than Plutarch attributes to them. As their own
words show:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Partly, too, there has been no time for preparation, for, as we
have seen, the invasion is a bolt from the blue, and after it has
first struck there is no convenient truce of thirty days before its
recurrence. Entreaty, says Sicinius, might help</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and it is the opinion of all.</p>

<p>Partly, too, the inertness of Rome is a tribute to the greatness of
the adversary, which is enhanced beyond the hyperboles of Plutarch, and
with which to inspire them the Volscians are irresistible.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But contrition, unpreparedness, despair of
success hardly excuse the palsy of incompetence into which this proud
aristocracy has now fallen. It does not of course sink so low as in
Plutarch. Of the first of the repeated deputations he narrates:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The ambassadours that were sent, were Martius
familliar friendes and acquaintaunce, who looked at the least for a
curteous welcome of him, as of their familliar friende and kynesman.
Howbeit they founde nothing lesse. For at their comming, they were
brought through the campe, to the place where he was set in his
chayer of state, with a marvelous and unspeakable majestie, having
the chiefest men of the Volsces about him: so he commaunded them to
declare openly the cause of their comming. Which they delivered in the
most humble and lowly wordes they possiblie could devise, and with all
modest countenaunce and behaviour agreeable for the same. When they had
done their message; for the injurie they had done him, he aunswered
them very hottely and in great choller.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
This is evidently the foundation of the interviews with Cominius and
Menenius respectively, and it is worth while noting the points of difference.</p>

<p>In the first place single individuals are substituted for an
unspecified number. Just in the same way the final deputation
consists of “Virgilia, Volumnia, leading young Marcius, Valeria,
and Attendants,” without any of “all the other Romaine Ladies” that
accompany them in Plutarch. In the last case it is the members and the
friend of Coriolanus’ family, in the previous cases it is his sworn
comrade Cominius and his idolatrous admirer Menenius who make the
appeal: and this at once gives their intercessions more of a personal
and less of a public character. One result of this with which we are
not now concerned, is that the rigour of Coriolanus’ first two answers
is considerably heightened; but at present it is more important to
observe that the impression of a formal embassy is avoided. Cominius
and Menenius strike us less as delegates from the Roman state, than
as private Romans who may suppose that their persuasions will have
special influence with their friend. There is nothing to indicate that
Cominius was official envoy of the republic, and we know that Menenius
went without any authorisation, in compliance with the request made
by Sicinius and Brutus in the street. Shakespeare’s senate is spared
the ignominy of the recurring supplications to which Plutarch’s senate
condescends. If these are not altogether suppressed, the references to
them are very faint and vague.</p>

<p>And also the suppliants bear themselves more worthily. Menenius is far
from employing “the most humble and lowly wordes” that could possibly
be devised or “the modest countenaunce and behaviour agreeable for the
same.” Cominius indeed tells how at the close of the interview, we may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>
suppose as a last resort, he “kneeled before” Coriolanus, but there was
no more loss of dignity in his doing so, consul and general though he
had been, than there was afterwards in Volumnia’s doing the same; and
his words as he repeats them do not show any lack of self-respect.</p>

<p>Still the inactivity, the helplessness, the want of nerve in the Roman
nobles in the hour of need are somewhat pitiful. It was the time to
justify their higher position by higher patriotism, resourcefulness
and courage. They do not make the slightest effort to do so. Remorse
for their desertion of Coriolanus need not have lamed their energies,
since now they would be confronting him not for themselves but for the
state. Even their “instant armies” might do something if commanded
and inspired by devoted captains. At the worst they could lead their
fellow-citizens to an heroic death. One cannot help feeling that if a
Coriolanus, or anyone with a tithe of his spirit, had been among them,
things would have been very different. But while they retain much of
the old caste pride, they have lost much of the old caste efficiency.</p>

<p>Thus Shakespeare, when he comes to the concrete, views with some
severity both the popular and the senatorial party. They show
themselves virulent and acrimonious in their relations with each
other, yet inconsequent even in their virulence and acrimony: then,
after having respectively enforced and permitted the banishment of
their chief defender, they are ready to succumb to him without a blow
when, it has well been said, he returns not even as an <i>émigré</i>
using foreign aid to restore the privileges of his own order and the
old <i>régime</i>, but as a barbarian bringing the national foe to
exterminate the state and all its members. And we cannot help asking:
Is this an adequate representation of the young republic that was ere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span>
long to become the mistress of the world? We must look steadily at
those general aspects of the story which we have noticed above, as well
as at the doings of the persons and parties amidst which Coriolanus is
set, if we would get the total effect of the play. Then it produces
something of the feeling which prompted Heine’s description of the
ancient Romans:</p>

<p class="blockquot">They were not great men, but through their
position they were greater than the other children of earth, for they
stood on Rome. Immediately they came down from the Seven Hills, they
were small.... As the Greek is great through the idea of Art, the
Hebrew through the idea of one most holy God; so the Romans are great
through the idea of their eternal Rome; great, wheresoever they have
fought, written or builded in the inspiration of this idea. The greater
Rome grew, the more this idea dilated: the individual lost himself in
it: the great men who remain eminent are borne up by this idea, and it
makes the littleness of the little men more pronounced.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p class="no-indent">The Idea of Rome! It is the triumph of that
which yields the promise and evidence of better things that the final
situation contains. The titanic intolerance of Coriolanus after being
expelled by fear and hatred from within, has threatened destruction
from without, and the threat has been averted. The presumptuous
intolerance of the demagogues, after imperilling the state, has been
discredited by its results, and their authority is destroyed. The Idea
of Rome in the patriotism of Volumnia has led to her self-conquest
and the conquest of her son, and is acclaimed by all alike. Thus we
have borne in upon us a feeling of the majesty and omnipotence of the
Eternal City, and we understand how it not only inspires and informs
the units that compose it, but stands out aloft and apart from its
faulty representatives as a kind of mortal deity that overrules their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
doings to its own ends, and against which their cavilling and
opposition are vain. What Menenius says to the rioters applies to all
dissentients:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">You may as well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 69.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, then, is the background against which are grouped with more or
less prominence, as their importance requires, Coriolanus’ family, his
associates, his rival, round the central figure of the hero himself.</p>

<p>Of the subordinate persons, by far the most imposing and influential
is Volumnia, the great-hearted mother, the patrician lady, the Roman
matron. The passion of maternity, whether interpreted as maternal love
or as maternal pride, penetrates her nature to the core, not, however,
to melt but to harden it. In her son’s existence she at first seems
literally wrapped up, and she implies that devotion to him rather than
to her dead husband has kept her from forming new ties:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">Thou hast never in thy life</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Loaden with honour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 160.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Marcius is thus the only son of his mother and
she a widow; but these reminiscences show how strictly the tenderness,
and still more the indulgence, usual in such circumstances, have been
banished from that home. In Plutarch the boy seeks a military career
from his irresistible natural bent:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Martius being more inclined to the warres, then
any young gentleman of his time: beganne from his Childehood to
geve him self to handle weapons, and daylie dyd exercise him selfe
therein.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>
In Shakespeare the direction and stimulus are much more directly
attributed to his mother, and it is she who first despatches him to the
field. This she herself expressly states in her admonition to Virgilia:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Volumnia.</i> I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in
a more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I should freelier
rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour, than in the embracements
of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness
plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings’ entreaties a
mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person, that it was no better than
picture-like to hang by the wall, if renown made it not stir, was
pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a
cruel war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows bound with
oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing
he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man.</p>

<p><i>Virgilia.</i> But had he died in the business, madam; how then?</p>

<p><i>Volumnia.</i> Then his good report
should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me
profess sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none
less dear than thine and my good Marcius, I had rather had eleven die
nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.</p>

oblige</i>, and is inspired by the same feeling which in Plutarch moves
Marcius to bid the patricians show that</p>

They are quite unqualified for self-government or for the criticism of
those above them. In comparison with the noble Coriolanus, the people,
whom she calls the rabble, are “cats” (<span class="smcap">iv.</span>
ii. 34). Naturally she is tenacious of the supremacy of her order, and
would fain see it make good its threatened privileges. She remonstrates
with her son for his contumacy:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Yet she has one feeling that outweighs both her
maternal and her aristocratic instincts, and that is devotion to her
country. This is the first and last and noblest thing in her. It is
the basis and mainspring of the training of her son; she wishes him to
serve the fatherland. It is the basis and mainspring of her patrician
partisanship; she honestly believes that the nobles alone are fit to
steer Rome to safety and honour. And to it she is willing to sacrifice
the two other grand interests of her life. When the call comes she is
ready for Rome, with its mechanics and tribunes as well as its senators
and patricians, to persuade her son to the step that will certainly
imperil and probably destroy him. It is public spirit of no ordinary
kind that makes such a nature disregard the dearest ties of family and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span>
caste, and all personal motives of love and vengeance, to intercede for
the city as a whole. But she puts her country first, and her words show

<p>Such a woman is made to be the mother of heroes. It is no wonder that
she has bred that colossal <i>Übermensch</i>, her son. But she has the
defects of her qualities. Her devotion is narrow in its intensity,
and in normal circumstances spares little recognition or tolerance
for those beyond its pale. Her contempt for the plebeians is open and
unrestrained. She was wont, says Coriolanus,</p>

<p class="no-indent">As Kreyssig points out, even great-hearted
mothers, proud of their warrior sons, do not often like to dwell
so realistically on havoc and slaughter and blood. But tenderness
and humanity are alien to her nature. When Valeria narrates
how young Marcius tore in pieces the butterfly, she interrupts
with obvious satisfaction: “One on’s father’s moods”
(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iii. 72). At her hearth Coriolanus would
not be taught much kindliness for Volscians or plebeians or any other of
the lower animals. Indeed, her own relations with her son depend on his
reverence rather than on his fondness. In the two collisions of their
wills he resists all her entreaties and endearments, but yields in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> ii. 130.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Similarly, at the end, all argument and complaint,
all pressure on the affections of Coriolanus are without avail, till
she turns upon him with a violence for which, as in the previous case,
Shakespeare found no authority in Plutarch:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Come, let us go:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 177.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And the great warrior and rebel cannot bear her rebuke.</p>

<p>These are instances both of the degree and the manner in which
Volumnia’s forceful character influences her son. Indeed it is easy to
see that for good and evil he is what she has made him. She is entitled
to say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent15">Thou art my warrior:</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>
the impartial onlooker cannot make the distinction. He is bone of her
bone and blood of her blood; and all her master impulses reappear in
him, though not so happily commingled or in such beneficent proportion.
The joint operation is different and in some respects opposite, but
there is hardly a feature in him that cannot be traced to its origin in
Volumnia, whether by heredity or education. This is just what we might
expect. Modern conjecture points to the mother rather than the father
as the source of will-power and character in the offspring; and in the
up-bringing of the boy Volumnia has had it all her own way. Plutarch,
as we saw, in his simple fashion, notices this as a disadvantage: and
though we may be sure that Plutarch’s insinuation of laxity could never
be breathed against Shakespeare’s Volumnia, still she could not give
her son more width and flexibility than her own narrow and rigid ideals
enjoined. Moreover, her limitations when transferred to the larger
sphere of his public efforts, would cramp and congest his powers, and
displace his interests.</p>

<p>Nor was there any other agency to divide the young man’s allegiance to
his mother or to counteract or temper her authority. Generally the most
powerful rivals of home influence are the companionship of friends,
and the love that founds a new home in marriage. But both of these
are either wanting in Coriolanus’ life, or serve only to deepen the
impressions made on him by Volumnia.</p>

<p>If, for example, we consider the relation of friendship, we cannot
but notice that Shakespeare gives him no intimate of his own years. A
French tragedian would infallibly have placed by his side the figure of
a confidant. Shakespeare was dispensed from the necessity by the freer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span>
usage of the Elizabethan stage and was at liberty to follow out the
hints which he found in Plutarch. Marcius was</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">churlishe, uncivill, and altogether unfit for any
mans conversation.... They could not be acquainted with him, as one
cittizen useth to be with another in the cittie. His behaviour was so
unpleasaunt to them, by reason of a certaine insolent and sterne manner
he had, which bicause it was to lordly, was disliked.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">So in Shakespeare he has no personal relations
with any of the younger generation, even their resort to him as their
congenial leader surviving, as has already been pointed out, only in
the desiccated phrase of a stage direction; and his only associates
are old or elderly men like Titus Lartius, the Consul Cominius, and
Menenius Agrippa. What sort of antidote could they supply against
his mother’s intolerant virtue? As Shakespeare conceives them, they
respectively follow in Marcius’ wake, or are powerless to change and
check his course, or even urge him forward.</p>

<p>Take Lartius, whom Shakespeare has drawn in a few rapid and vigorous
strokes. He is old and stiff, but ready if need be to lean on one
crutch and fight with the other, prompt to take a sporting wager, and,
when he wins, eager to remit the stake in his admiration for the noble
youngster, to whom with all his years he grants priority, whom on his
supposed death he laments as an irreplaceable jewel, whom he hails as
the living force that dwells within the trappings of their armament.
Clearly from this cheery old fighting man, with his reverential
enthusiasm for Marcius’ fighting powers in voice, looks and blows, we
need not expect much correction of Marcius’ restiveness at the civic curb.</p>

<p>Cominius would seem more likely to prove a fitting Mentor, for to his
love and esteem he adds discretion. In Shakespeare, though he “has
years upon him,” he is the avowed friend and comrade-in-arms of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>
younger man; the brave and prudent general, “neither foolish in his
stands, nor cowardly in retire”; who, perhaps from seniority, holds the
position to which the other might aspire, but who confidently appeals
to his promise of service. For their mutual affection is untouched by
jealousy, and Cominius not only extols his heroism in the camp, but is
his warmest advocate in the Senate. He resents the citizens’ fickleness
and the tribunes’ trickery at the election as unworthy of Rome as well
as insulting to her hero, and is indignant at the attempt to arrest
Coriolanus; but he abhors civil brawls, and, just as in the field so in
the city, he bows to “odds beyond arithmetic,” and considers that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Manhood is call’d foolery, when it stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against a falling fabric.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 246.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So he counsels Marcius’ withdrawal from the
hostile mob, and afterwards dispassionately states the three courses
open to him, with some hesitation sanctioning the method of compromise
if the hothead can bring himself to give it fair play. When his doubts
prove true, he interposes first with a remonstrance to his friend, and
then with a solemn appeal to the people; and though in neither case is
he allowed to finish, his efforts do not flag. He wishes to accompany
the exile for a month, and maintain a correspondence with him and have
everything in readiness for his recall. And if, when the invasion takes
place, he rails at those who have brought about the calamity, that
does not hinder him from his vain but zealous attempt at intercession.
Altogether a sagacious, loyal, generous, but somewhat ineffective
character, who wins our respect rather for what he essays than for what
he achieves; for he brings nothing to a successful issue. With the best
will in the world, which he has, and with more freedom from class
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
prejudice than can in point of fact be attributed to him, such an one
could do little to tame or bridle his friend.</p>

<p>There remains Menenius, with his much more strongly marked character,
and with the fuller opportunities that a close intimacy could procure.
Were Marcius and he of the same flesh and blood, their affection could
hardly be greater. When debating with himself whether to try his
mediation, this thought encourages the old man: “He call’d me father”
(<span class="allsmcap">v.</span> i. 3). He tells the Volscian sentinel:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>You shall perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me
from my son Coriolanus.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 67.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And when they meet, he hails him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular
prosperity, and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does!
&emsp;O, my son, my son!</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 72.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Nor are these statements idle brags; they are
borne out by Coriolanus’ own words when he dismisses him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">For I loved thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take this along; I writ it for thy sake,&emsp;[<i>Gives a letter</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And would have sent it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 95.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And again he tells Aufidius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">This last old man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom with a crack’d heart I have sent to Rome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loved me above the measure of a father;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, godded me, indeed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 8.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the last expression may give an explanation
both of the young man’s condescension to fondness and of the
unprofitableness of Menenius’ influence. He is too much dazzled by the
glories of his splendid adoptive son. His enthusiasm knows no bounds.
No lover is more enraptured at receiving a <i>billet doux</i> from his
mistress, than is the old man when the youth on whom he dotes, deigns
to write to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven years’ health; in

<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 125.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">He may occasionally interpose a mild hint of
remonstrance against Marcius’ vehemence, but it is solely on the ground
of expediency, not at all on the ground of principle; and on the whole
he belongs to that not very edifying class of devotees who can say of a
friend,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Whate’er he does seems well done to me.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Of which he himself is not altogether unaware. He
tells the Volscian sentinel:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">I tell thee, fellow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy general is my lover: I have been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The book of his good acts, whence men have read</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His fame unparallel’d, haply amplified:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I have ever verified my friends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of whom he’s chief, with all the size that verity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have almost stamp’d the leasing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 13.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This attitude, then, accounts for Coriolanus’ predilection for the old
senator, and also reduces the value of the relation as an educative
agency. Youthful recklessness will meet with no inconvenient thwarting,
<i>i.e.</i> with no salutary rebuke, from such an adorer. But of course
in the blindest friendship there is always the unconscious influence
and criticism of the admirer’s own walk and conversation. And at first
sight it might seem that this influence and criticism Menenius was well
fitted to supply. He, too, like Volumnia, puts Rome before all other
considerations, as is shown not only by his undertaking the mission to
the Volscian camp, but by his action all through the drama. He is ever
willing to play the part of mediator. Now we find him soothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</span>
the people, now we find him soothing Coriolanus. When the banishment
is an accomplished fact, he endeavours to mitigate the outbursts of
Volumnia; and Sicinius bears witness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O, he is grown most kind of late.</div>
    <div class="verse indent19">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vi. 11.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">During all the tumult of the election and the
<i>émeute</i> he keeps his head and his heart; for he is inspired by
the right civic feeling that there must be no civil war.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Proceed by process;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 314.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And with this patriotism, partly as its result, he
combines singular moderation, at least in principle and thought, if not
in language. He is always ready to commend and accept compromises. He
says to the tribune,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Be that you seem, truly your country’s friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And temperately proceed to what you would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus violently redress.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 218.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">On the other hand, when Marcius draws he
sees the mistake and interposes: “Down with that sword”
(<span class="smcap">iii.</span> i. 226); and only when the tribunes persist
in their attack does he himself resort to force, which, however, he
is glad to abandon at the first opportunity. And this moderation
comes the more easily to him that he has a real kindliness even for
the plebeians. It is assuredly no small compliment that at the very
height of the popular violence this patrician and senator, the known
and avowed friend of Coriolanus, should be chosen by the tribunes
themselves as their own delegate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent15">Noble Menenius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be you then as the people’s officer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 329.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This confirms the testimony given him by the First Citizen in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span>
opening scene: “He’s one honest enough” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 54); and the
Second Citizen describes him as</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved the people.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> i. 52.)</p>
</div>
<p class="no-indent">He has indeed a sympathy with them, that shows
itself in the russet and kersey of his speech. The haughty Coriolanus
despises the household words of the common folk, and cites them only
to ridicule them, but Menenius’ phrases of their own accord run to the
homespun and proverbial. He addresses the obtrusive citizen: “You, the
great toe of this assembly” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 159).
The dissension at Rome is a rent that “must be patch’d with cloth of
any colour” (<span class="smcap">iii.</span> i. 252). Coriolanus’ rough
words he excuses on the ground that he is</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">ill school’d</div>

    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> i. 321.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He figures the relentlessness of the returned
exile as “yon coign o’ the Capitol, yon corner-stone” (<span
class="allsmcap">v.</span> iv. 1), and is at no loss for illustrations
of the change that has come over the outcast:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>There is a differency between a grub and a butterfly, yet

<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv. 11.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And with similes for Coriolanus’ present temper he
positively overflows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>He no more remembers his mother now than an eight-year-old horse.
The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv. 16.)</p>
<p>There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iv. 29.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">All his thoughts clothe themselves in the pat,
familiar image, and this is no doubt a great help to him in persuading
his auditors, for which he has an undeniable talent. His famous
apologue, besides being a masterpiece in its kind, worthy of La
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span>
Fontaine at his best, completely answers its immediate purpose; and in
the later scene he is able to lull the storm that Coriolanus and the
tribunes have raised, and obtain from the infuriated demagogues what
are in some sort favourable terms. But he is assisted in this by his
genuine joviality and <i>bonhomie</i>. He is one of those people who
permit themselves a little indulgence that we hardly blame, for it is
only one side of their pervasive good nature. Menenius is in truth
something of a belly-god and wine-bibber. When he hears news of Marcius
he promptly decides how to celebrate the occasion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I will make my very house reel to-night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 121.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and he has already confessed that he is known to be</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop
of allaying Tiber in’t; ... one that converses more with the buttock of
the night than with the forehead of the morning.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 52 and 56.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is almost comic to hear him consoling
Volumnia on her son’s banishment when she moves off to lament “in
anger, Juno-like,” with an invitation: “You’ll sup with me?” (<span
class="smcap">iv.</span> ii. 49). And wholly comic is his explanation
of Cominius’ rebuff by Coriolanus, an explanation suggested no doubt by
subjective considerations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He was not taken well; he had not dined:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The veins unfill’d, our blood is cold, and then</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i. 50.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the worthy <i>bon-vivant</i> is thoroughly in
earnest, and in the crisis of his altercation with the sentinel harks
back to this key of the position, as he supposes it to be:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not speak with

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span>
All these, however, are very human weaknesses, that sort well with
the geniality of the man, and, just because they are very human
weaknesses, might have a wholesome rather than a prejudicial effect on
the overstrained tensity of Marcius. So far then, despite the excessive
and uncritical in Menenius’ love, his patriotism, his moderation, his
popular bent, commended by his persuasive tongue and companionable
ways, might tend to supplement the defects and transcend the
limitations of Volumnia’s training. But Menenius has other qualities
akin to, or associated with, those that we have discussed, which would
have a more questionable and not less decisive influence. He admits
that he is</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 53.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">That is, he neglects the wise counsel, “Hear
the other side,” and jumps to his conclusion at once. This is quite
in keeping with the partiality that makes him magnify the virtues of
his friends, and with his assumption that, since his own intercession
has failed, that of Volumnia can have no effect. He prejudges, in
other words he is prejudiced. We do not have any instance of this in
his acts, but we have many in his unconsidered sayings, that, as he
imagines, are to have no consequence beyond the moment.</p>

<p>Then he goes on to confess that he has the reputation of being “hasty
and tinder-like upon too trivial motion” (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i. 55), which
means that he loses patience and fires up without adequate ground; and
of this too we have ample evidence. He is wonderfully forbearing and
longsuffering if matters of any moment are at stake, but if he has
gained his point, or if there is nothing to gain and nothing to lose,
he rails and mocks in Coriolanus’ own peculiar vein. Thus, when he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</span>
convinced the mob, he feels free to make the ringleader his butt.
When the tribunes profess to “know him,” that is, to understand his
character, he overwhelms them with peppery banter. When the news of
Coriolanus’ invasion arrives, in unrestrained indignation he upbraids
the people and their blind guides with their imbecility. But it will
be observed that no harm ever comes by any of these ebullitions. They
have no after-effects. If something has to be done, no one could be
more sagacious and conciliatory than Menenius. Dr. Johnson said of him,
perhaps more in exercise of his right as a sturdy old Tory to twit
those in high places, than in deliberate appreciation of the facts:
“Shakespeare wanted a buffoon and he went to the Senate House for
that with which the Senate House would certainly have supplied him.”
Similarly, in the play Brutus is rash enough to answer him back:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 90.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">But Menenius deserves neither taunt. It was no
parliamentary wag or social lampooner whom the Senate entrusted with
the task of addressing the rioters, or who persuaded the triumphant
tribunes to a compromise. The charges nevertheless have a foundation in
so far that Menenius, partly in jest, partly in irritation, gives his
tongue rein unless he sees reason to curb it, and allows his choleric
impulses full expression. These random ejaculations are taken at their
proper value by himself and others. As he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 58.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">He is obviously one of those estimable and
deservedly popular people whose deliberate views are just and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</span>
penetrating, and who are gifted with the power of commending them,
but who are none the less liked because they do not always think it
necessary to have themselves in hand, but let themselves go on the full
career of their own half-jocular, half-serious likes and dislikes, when
for the moment they are free from graver responsibilities.</p>

<p>Now this of itself was no very good example for Coriolanus. He
adopts Menenius’ headlong frankness, but without Menenius’ tacit
presupposition of good-humoured hyperbole. He utters what he thinks but
he does not spend his malice in his breath. His friend would do nothing
to teach him restraint and reserve, but would rather, if he influenced
him at all, influence him to surcharge his invectives and double-barb
his flouts.</p>

<p>But not only so. These instinctive likes and dislikes, which the old
patrician could not but feel but which he never allowed to interfere
with his practical policy, were the guiding principles of his less
cautious friend. It must be admitted that there is no abuse of the
citizens or their officers to which Coriolanus gives vent, but can be
paralleled with something as strong from the mouth of Menenius. This
worthy senior who hath always loved the people, turns from the tribunes
with the insult:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p class="no-indent">In this mood he asks them in regard to Coriolanus:</p>

<p class="no-indent">He has to the full the aristocratic loathing for

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</span>
These are his authentic innate prejudices that he controls and
represses by the help of his reason and his patriotism, when the
emergency requires: but they are there; and he would be no more careful
to restrain them in his familiar circle than a squatter at his club
feels called upon to restrain his opinions about the Labour Party,
though he may be very proud of Australia, and a very kindly master,
and though he would neither publish them in an election address nor
perhaps justify them in his serious moments to himself. And this, we
may suppose, was the sort of conversation Marcius would hear as a lad
from his old friend. There would be little in it to modify the pride
and prejudice he derived from his mother.</p>

<p>And lastly, coming to the other possible corrective, would his wife
be likely to soften the asperities of temper and opinion that were
his by nature and by second nature? At first we might say Yes. She
takes comparatively little pleasure in the brilliance of his career
and is more concerned for his life than for his glory. When Volumnia
recalls how she sent him forth as a lad to win honour, Virgilia’s heart
pictures his possible death, and how would that have been compensated?
For she loves in the first place not the hero but the husband, and her
love makes her timorous. She has none of her mother-in-law’s assurance
that his prowess is without match and beyond comparison. When “wondrous
things” are told of him how characteristic are their respective comments:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Virgilia.</i> The gods grant them true!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Volumnia.</i> True! pow, wow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 154.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">How differently they feel about his contest with
his rival:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Virgilia.</i> Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Volumnia.</i> He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tread upon his neck.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 48.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</span>
So she shrinks from the thoughts of blood and wounds over which
Volumnia gloats, and trembles at the dangers of the campaign. Devoured
by suspense, she is in no mood to meet the ordinary social claims
on her rank and sex, but shuts herself up within her four walls,
and wears out the time over household tasks. Her seclusion, and the
attempts to withdraw her from it, must not be misunderstood. They
have sometimes been taken as pictures of domestic narrow-mindedness
on the one hand, and callous frivolity on the other. But frivolity is
unthinkable in Volumnia; we may be sure she would never advise or do
anything unbefitting the Roman matron. And it is quite opposed to the
impression Valeria produces; we may be sure she would never suggest it.
In Plutarch’s story it is she who proposes and urges the deputation of
women to Coriolanus, and though Shakespeare, to suit his own purpose,
transfers by implication the credit of this to Volumnia, Plutarch’s
statement was enough to prevent him from transforming the true
authoress of the idea into the fashionable gadabout that some critics
have alleged her to be. On the contrary, with him she calls forth the
most purely poetical passage in the whole play, and she does so by the
vestal dignity and severity of her character. Coriolanus greets her in
the camp:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The noble sister of Publicola,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That’s curdied by the frost of purest snow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hangs on Dian’s temple: dear Valeria!</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 65.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The woman to whom this splendid compliment is paid
by one who never speaks otherwise than he thinks, is assuredly no more
obnoxious than Volumnia herself to the charge of levity. They are both
great high-hearted Roman ladies who do not let their private or public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</span>
solicitudes interfere with their customary social routine, and Valeria
visits her friend to cheer her in her anxiety, as she would have her,
in turn, visit and comfort their common acquaintance. But Virgilia is
cast in a gentler mould; though neither is she lacking in character,
spirit and magnanimity. Of course she is not an aggressive woman, and
she feels that the home is the place for her. She speaks seldom, and
when she does her words are few. It is typical that she greets her
husband when he returns a victor with no articulate welcome, but with
her more eloquent tears. He addresses her in half humorous, half tender
reproach:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent15">My gracious silence, hail!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wouldst thou have laugh’d had I come coffin’d home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That weep’st to see me triumph?</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> i. 192.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">A wonderful touch that comes from a wonderful
insight. It may well be asked, as it has been asked, how Shakespeare
<i>knew</i> that Virgilia’s heart was too full for words.</p>

<p>But with all this, she shows abundant resolution, readiness and
patriotism. She is adamant to the commands of her imperious
mother-in-law and the entreaties of her insistent friend when they urge
her to break her self-imposed retirement. She, too, has her rebuke for
the insolent tribunes. Above all, she, too, plays her part in turning
Coriolanus from his revenge. In that scene, after her wont, she does
not say much, less than two lines in all, that serve to contain the
simple greeting and the quick answer to her husband’s warning that he
no longer sees things as he did:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sorrow that delivers us thus changed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes you think so.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 39.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But who shall say that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">those dove’s eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which can make gods forsworn,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</span>
did not shed their influence on his mother’s demand, and help him
to break his vindictive vow. Remember, too, that the sacrifice this
implied would mean more to her than to Volumnia, for though she
likewise can dedicate what she holds dearest on the altar of her
country, her affections, her home, Marcius as an individual, bulk more
largely in her life.</p>

<p>And if she loves him, we see how fondly he loves her. More than once or
twice he alludes to his happiness as bridegroom, husband, and father.
When she appears before him, his ejaculations and the tenderness of his
appeal,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Best of my flesh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forgive my tyranny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 42.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">speak volumes in a mouth like his for the keenness
of his affection. To express the bliss that he feels in the salute of
reunion, this hero-lover can find analogues only in his banishment and
his vengeance:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent17">O, a kiss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I carried from thee, dear: and my true lip</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath virgin’d it e’er since.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 44.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>This woman, then, with her love and sweetness, that strike such
responsive chords in the rude breast of her lord, is apparently well
fitted to smooth the harshness of his dealings with his fellow-men: and
this would seem all the more likely since her gentleness is not of that
flabby kind that cannot hold or bind, but is strengthened by firmness
of will and largeness of feeling.</p>

<p>All the same, she exerts no influence whatever before the very end on
her husband’s public life or even on his general character, because
she has no interest in or aptitude for concerns of his busy, practical
career. She has chosen her own orbit in her home, and her love has no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</span>
desire to step beyond. We have seen that, according to Plutarch,
Volumnia was entrusted with the selection of her son’s wife. This
Shakespeare omits, perhaps as incongruous with the spontaneousness of
the relation between his wedded lovers, but it may have left a trace
in the position he assigns to Virgilia. The mother-in-law has and
claims the leading place; and, as Kreyssig remarks, with a woman of
the daughter-in-law’s steady inflexibility, collisions more proper for
comedy than for tragedy must inevitably ensue, unless there were a
strict delimitation of spheres. Volumnia continues to be prompter and
guide in all matters political. She has all the outward precedence.
On his return from Corioli, her son gives her the prior reverence and
salutation, and, only as it were by her permission, turns to his wife.
When the deputation of ladies appears in his presence before Rome,
he seems for a moment to be surprised out of his decorum, and his
first words of passionate greeting are for Virgilia; but he presently
recovers, and, with a certain accent of reproof, turns on himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">You gods! I prate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the most noble mother of the world</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i’ the earth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of thy deep duty more impression show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than that of common sons.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 48.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Evidently, his love for his wife, intense though
it be, is a thing apart, a sanctuary of his most inmost feeling, and is
quite out of relation with the affairs of the jostling world. In them
his mother has supreme sway, and Virgilia’s unobtrusive graciousness
does not exercise even an indirect influence on his ingrained
principles and prejudices. She is no makeweight against the potent
authority of Volumnia.</p>

<span class="h_subtitle">THE GREATNESS OF CORIOLANUS. AUFIDIUS</span></h3>
</div>

<p>In the atmosphere then of Volumnia’s predominance we are to imagine
young Marcius growing up from infancy to boyhood, from boyhood
to youth, environed by all the most inspiring and most exclusive
traditions of an old Roman family of the bluest blood. After the
expulsion of the Tarquins, we must suppose that there was no more
distinguished <i>gens</i> than his. The tribune Brutus gives the long
bead-roll of his ancestry, the glories of which, as has already been
shown, are even exaggerated in his statement through Shakespeare’s
having made a little mistake in regard to Plutarch’s account, and
having included representatives of later among those of former
generations. But Volumnia is not the mother to let him rest on the
achievements of his predecessors; he must make them his own by
equalling or excelling them. He begins as a boy, and already in his
maiden fight his exploits rouse admiration. Plutarch describes the
circumstance:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The first time he went to the warres, being but a
strippling, was when Tarquine surnamed the prowde ... dyd come to Rome
with all the ayde of the Latines, and many other people of Italie....
In this battell, wherein were many hotte and sharpe encounters of
either partie, Martius valliantly fought in the sight of the Dictator;
and a Romaine souldier being throwen to the ground even hard by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</span>
him, Martius straight bestrid him, and slue the enemie with
his owne handes that had overthrowen the Romaine. Hereupon,
after the battell was wonne, the Dictator dyd not forget so
noble an acte, and therefore first of all he crowned Martius
with a garland of oken boughs.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This furnishes Cominius with the prologue to his
eulogy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent25">At sixteen years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When with his Amazonian chin he drove</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The bristled lips before him: he bestrid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An o’erpress’d Roman and i’ the consul’s view</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Slew three opposers: Tarquin’s self he met</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And struck him on his knee: in that day’s feats,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When he might act the woman in the scene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He proved the best man i’ the field, and for his meed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was brow-bound with the oak.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">II.</span> ii. 91.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But it will be noticed that in Shakespeare’s
version Marcius’ prowess is enhanced: not one opponent but three fall
before him; he confronts the arch-enemy himself, and has the best of
it. Similarly his derring-do at Corioli is raised to the superhuman.
Plutarch’s statement, as he feels, makes demands, but it is moderate
compared with Shakespeare’s.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Martius being in the throng emong the enemies,
thrust him selfe into the gates of the cittie, and entred the same
emong them that fled, without that any one of them durst at the first
turne their face upon him, or els offer to slaye him. But he looking
about him and seeing he was entred the cittie with very fewe men
to helpe him, and perceyving he was envirouned by his enemies that
gathered round about to set apon him: dyd things then as it is written,
wonderfull and incredible: ... By this meanes, Lartius that was gotten
out, had some leysure to bring the Romaines with more safetie into the
cittie.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Here he is accompanied at least by a few, among
whom, it is implied, the valiant Lartius is one, and Lartius having
extricated himself, comes back with reinforcements to help him. But in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</span>
Shakespeare he is from beginning to end without assistance, and his
boast, “Alone I did it,” is the literal truth. The first soldier says,
discreetly passing over the disobedience of the men:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Following the fliers at the very heels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clapp’d to their gates: he is himself alone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To answer all the city.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iv. 49.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And Cominius reports:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Alone he enter’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The mortal gate of the city, which he painted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With shunless destiny; aidless came off.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> ii. 114.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But he is not merely, though he is conspicuously,
a soldier. He is also a general who once and again gives proof of
his strategic skill. Nor do his qualifications stop here. He has the
forethought and insight of a statesman, at any rate in matters of
foreign and military policy. He has anticipated the attack of the
Volsces with which the play begins, as we learn from the remark of the
First Senator:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Marcius, ’tis true that you have lately told us;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Volsces are in arms.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 231.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So after their disaster at Corioli, he estimates
the situation aright, when even Cominius is mistaken, and conjectures
that the enemy is only waiting an opportunity for renewing the war:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So then the Volsces stand but as at first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon’s again.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> i. 4.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And this, as we presently learn, is quite correct.</p>

<p>Even in political statesmanship, the department in which he is supposed
to be specially to seek, he has a sagacity and penetration that show
him the centre of the problem. This does not necessarily mean that
his solution is the true one; and still less does it mean that he is
wise in proclaiming his views when and where he does so: but the views
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</span>
themselves are certainly deep-reaching and acute, and such as would win
approval from some of the greatest builders of states, the Richelieus,
the Fredericks, the Bismarcks. He is quite right in denying that his
invectives against the policy of concession are due to “choler”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Choler!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By Jove, ’twould be my mind!</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> i. 84.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">His objections are in truth no outbreaks of
momentary exasperation, though that may have added pungency to their
expression, but mature and sober convictions, that have a worth and
weight of their own. As we might expect; for Shakespeare derives almost
all of them from Plutarch; and Plutarch, who had thought about these
things, puts several of his favourite ideas in Coriolanus’ mouth, even
while condemning Coriolanus’ bigotry and harshness; and while, for
dramatic fitness, suppressing the qualifications and provisos that he
himself thought essential.</p>

<p>To Marcius the root of the matter is to be found in the fact that the
Roman Republic is not a democracy but an aristocracy, and in this
respect he contrasts it with some of the Greek communities.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Therefore sayed he, they that gave counsell, and
persuaded that the corne should be geven out to the common people
<i>gratis</i>, as they used to doe in citties of Graece, where
the people had more absolute power; dyd but only nourishe their
disobedience, which would breake out in the ende, to the utter ruine
and overthrowe of the whole state.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare’s transcription is, but for the
interpolated interruption, fairly close:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i> Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth</div>

<p class="no-indent">The grand mistake was the distribution of corn,

refused to goe to the warres, when they were commaunded: neither for

forsaken their countrie: neither for their accusations which their
flatterers have preferred unto them, and they have receyved, and made
good against the Senate: but they will rather judge we geve and graunt
them this, as abasing our selves, and standing in feare of them, and
glad to flatter them every waye.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</span>
These weighty arguments, which Coriolanus is quite entitled to call
his “reasons,” for reasons they are, are substantially reproduced in
Shakespeare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent23">They know the corn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was not our recompense, resting well assured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They ne’er did service for’t: being press’d to the war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even when the navel of the state was touched,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ the war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which they have often made against the senate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All cause unborn, could never be the motive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How shall this bisson multitude digest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What’s like to be their words: “We did request it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are the greater poll, and in true fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The nature of our seats and make the rabble</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call our cares fears: which will in time</div>

    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> i. 120.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">That seems convincing enough. Their refusal
of military service shows that the citizens merited no leniency
from the state, the charge that the patricians were hoarding stores
was universally known to be baseless, so the malcontents can only
infer that the senate gave the largesse in fright, and find in this
encouragement for their usurpations. And in the meantime, while
doubt exists as to the real centre of authority, the effect must
be vacillation in the policy of the republic and neglect of the
most urgent measures. This was a consideration that came home to
Shakespeare, who never forgot the weakness and misery of his own
country when it was torn by civil strife, so he calls urgent attention
to it at the close. This is the only portion of the speech that is
quite original so far as the thought is concerned.

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">All this contains a measure of truth that is valid
in all times; from the point of view of the aristocratic republican
it is absolutely true. Coriolanus’ diagnosis of the case is minutely
correct and every one of his prognostics is fulfilled. The plebs
does proceed with its encroachments; the power of Rome is strangely
weakened as the immediate result of the struggle; the foreign policy is
short-sighted and unwise; the pressing need of defence is overlooked.
Of course the answer is that his uncompromising suggestions might
have led to a worse revolution, and that in the long run a great deal
more was gained than lost: but the important point to note is that
his views are certainly arguable, that much could be said for them,
that at the very least they assert one aspect of the real facts, and
are as far as possible from being the mere tirades of a brainless
aristocratic swashbuckler. As already pointed out they give just the
sort of estimate that some of the wisest statesmen who have ever lived
would have formed of the situation. It is quite conceivable that his
proposals if carried through with vigour and ruthlessness would have
settled things satisfactorily at least for the moment. So besides
his pre-eminence in war and generalship and his foresight in foreign
affairs, we may claim for Coriolanus not indeed political tact but
political grip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</span>
And to these qualifications of physical prowess and intellectual force
he adds others of a more distinctively moral description.</p>

<p>Among these the most obvious is his extreme truthfulness. He has no
idea of equivocation or even of reticence. Menenius says of him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">His heart’s his mouth:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> i. 257.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Nor is his veracity confined to words; he is
honest and genuine to the core of his nature and will not stoop to a
gesture that belies his feeling:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">I will not do’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And by my body’s action teach my mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A most inherent baseness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> ii. 120.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And following on this is his innate loyalty.
Nothing revolts him like a breach of that obligation, and in the crises
of his career it is the accusation of treason that rouses him to a
frenzy. Thus, after his imprudent speech, Sicinius cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As traitors do.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> i. 162.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And Coriolanus bursts out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is the same word that scatters his prudent
resolutions in the trial scene:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Sicinius.</i><span class="ws3">You are a traitor to the people.</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i> How! traitor!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Menenius.</i><span class="ws5">Nay, temperately; your promise.</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i> The fires i’ the lowest hell fold-in the people!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In thy hands clutch’d as many millions, in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou liest” unto thee with a voice as free</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I do pray the gods.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> iii. 66.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</span>
And similarly when Aufidius calls him traitor, he repeats the
word “Traitor! how now!” in a wrath that is for the moment almost
speechless, till it overflows in a torrent of reckless abuse. It is
part of the tragic irony of the play that with his ingrained horror of
such an offence, he should yet in very truth let himself be hurried
into treason against his country. For all his instincts are on the
side of faith and troth and obligation. When he wishes to express his
hostility to Aufidius he can think of no better comparison than this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Worse than a promise-breaker.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> viii. 1.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">One result of this is that he has a simple
reverence for all prescriptive ties, which suffuses his stern nature
with a certain tinge of kindly humanity. His piety to his mother comes
of course from Plutarch; but his tenderness for his wife and delight
in his son, lightly but strongly marked, are Shakespearean traits. So
is the intimacy with Menenius, which greatly removes the impression of
“churlishness” and “solitariness” that Plutarch’s portrait conveys; and
his self-effacement in obedience to the powers that be and to the word
that he has pledged, appears in his willing acceptance of a subordinate
rank. The tribunes wonder that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">His insolence can brook to be commanded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Under Cominius;</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 266.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and attribute it to base calculation in keeping
with their own natures; but to this view Shakespeare’s story gives no
support. The real explanation is simpler: it is his former promise and
he is constant (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 241).</p>

<p>Even more pleasant is the famous instance of his respect for the claims
of hospitality. This episode is obtained from Plutarch, but in several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</span>
respects it is completely altered. After describing how Coriolanus
declined all special reward, the original narrative proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Only this grace (sayed he) I crave, and beseeche
you to graunt me. Among the Volsces there is an olde friende and hoste
of mine, an honest wealthie man and now a prisoner, who living before
in great wealthe in his owne countrie, liveth now a poore prisoner in
the handes of his enemies: and yet notwithstanding all this his miserie
and misfortune, it would do me great pleasure if I could save him
from this one daunger: to keepe him from being solde as a slave.” The
souldiers hearing Martius wordes, made a marvelous great showte among
them.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Compare this with the scene in Shakespeare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i> The gods begin to mock me. I, that now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of my lord general.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cominius.</i> Take’t; ’tis yours. What is’t?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i> I sometime lay here in Corioli</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At a poor man’s house: he used me kindly:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But then Aufidius was within my view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And wrath o’erwhelmed my pity: I request you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To give my poor host freedom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Cominius.</i>          O well begg’d!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were he the butcher of my son, he should</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Lartius.</i> Marcius, his name?</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i>    By Jupiter! forgot.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have we no wine here?</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 79.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The postponement of pity to wrath is a new
characteristic detail which shows how these gentler impulses in
Coriolanus must yield to his ruling passions. On the other hand his
host is transformed from a rich to a poor man, and thus his humanity
acquires a wider range, and we see how it can extend beyond his own
class if only there is a personal claim on it. Above all there is the
new illuminating touch of the lapse of memory. Sometimes this has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</span>
taken as betraying the indifference of the aristocrat for an inferior
whose name he does not think it worth while to remember. Surely not.
Coriolanus is experiencing the collapse that follows his superhuman
exertions, the exhaustion of body and mind when one cannot think of the
most familiar words: but he rallies his strength for a last effort,
and is just able to intercede for his humble guest-friend ere he
succumbs.</p>

<p>And this last passage brings before us another of his magnanimous
qualities. He has refused most princely gifts. No one can accuse him of
covetousness. His patrician bigotry aims at power and leadership, not
at material perquisites. After the double battle, won almost entirely
by his instrumentality, when Cominius offers him the tenth, he makes
the generous answer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">I thank you, general;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But cannot make my heart consent to take</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 36.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He deserves the encomium of the consul:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Our spoils he kick’d at,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And look’d upon things precious as they were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The common muck of the world: he covets less</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than misery itself would give; rewards</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His deeds with doing them, and is content</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To spend the time to end it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> ii. 128.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He “rewards his deeds with doing them,” without
thought of ulterior profit or of anything beyond the worthy occupation
of the moment. This leads to the next point, his cult of honour; and
it must be confessed that he conceives it in a very lofty and noble
way. His view of it reminds one of Arthur’s saying in Tennyson’s
<i>Idylls</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">For the deed’s sake my knighthood do the deed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not to be noised of.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Honour, of course, is not the highest possible
principle. It implies a certain quest for recognition, and in so far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</span>
has a personal and even selfish aspect. But in the right kind of honour
the recognition is sought, in the first place, for real excellences
that, in the second place, are determined only by competent judges, in
some cases only by the individual’s own conscience. In both respects
Coriolanus bears examination.</p>

<p>Of course, when there is any pursuit of honour at all, it is almost
impossible to exclude some admixture of rivalry and emulation: for
the desire of recognition, if only by oneself, carries with it the
desire of being recognised as having achieved the very best: and
rivalry and emulation must to that extent have an egoistic direction.
Coriolanus has these feelings to the full, and often gives them extreme
expression in regard to his one possible competitor Aufidius. He calls
him “the man of my soul’s hate” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span>
v. 11); and tells him: “I have ever followed thee with hate”
(<span class="smcap">iv.</span> v. 104). Aufidius has equal animosity
against Coriolanus. His correspondent, to give an idea of his rival’s
unpopularity with his townsmen, writes of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Lartius reports how the Volscian has said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="no-indent">Marcius, hearing he is at Antium, sums up for both:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">To oppose his hatred fully.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> i. 19.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">As Tullus sums up on his side:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent21">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> viii. 2.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Still, it is precisely in his relations with
Aufidius, and in comparison with Aufidius’ passions and purposes, that
Coriolanus’ finer conception of honour becomes apparent. The true

warrior values these encounters for themselves, and has a rapture in
them second to none that he knows. He exclaims:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Upon my party, I’ld revolt, to make</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">That I am proud to hunt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> i. 237·)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This has sometimes been regarded as a hint in
advance of Marcius’ readiness to desert the national cause. But
that seems to be taking <i>au pied de la lettre</i> one of those
conversational audacities that much discreeter men than he often permit
themselves. It is rather an exaggerated expression of his delight in
the contest, and an ironical comment on his later abandonment of it for
the sake of revenge. At any rate even if the worst interpretation be
put on it, it suggests a more respectable motive for desertion than the
parallel outburst of Aufidius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> x. 4.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">For Coriolanus would change sides in order to
confront the severest test, Aufidius would do so in order not to be
of the defeated party. There is a meanness and bitterness in Tullus
from which his rival is wholly free. All through, Marcius shows
the generosity of conscious heroism. He is very handsome in his
acknowledgment of Aufidius’ merits:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">In their trials of valour he takes no advantage,

Then, when they meet, he dissembles his hurts, and cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">Within these three hours, Tullus,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Wherein thou seest me mask’d: for thy revenge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wrench up thy power to the highest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> viii. 7.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">They are pledged to slay each other or be slain.
Tullus has told the senators:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike</div>

    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 34.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And to this he adds boasts of his own, which
Coriolanus omits. Nevertheless, though his professions are the loudest,
Aufidius makes good neither pledge nor boasts, but lets himself be
driven back despite the assistance of his friends. And then, just as he
would rather be a successful Roman than a defeated Volsce, his thoughts
turn to getting the better of his victor by whatever means; he cannot
take his beating in a sportsmanlike way, and thus shows finally how
hollow is the honour after which he strives. Whether intentionally or
not, Lartius’ report gives a true description of his feeling:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">He would pawn his fortunes</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">“Be call’d”; as though the vain ascription of
superiority were all that he desired. But in truth he has already made
the same confession in so many words, with the more damaging admission
that he now feels as though he no longer cared by what foul play such
ascription is won.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">On this passage Coleridge comments:</p>

<p class="blockquot">I have such deep faith in Shakespeare’s
heart-lore, that I take for granted that this is in nature, and not
as a mere anomaly; although I cannot in myself discover any germ
of possible feeling, which could wax and unfold itself into such a
sentiment as this.</p>

<p class="no-indent">It seems strange that Coleridge should say this,
for it is proved by not a few examples that baffled emulation may
issue in an envy which knows few restraints. Perhaps it was the avowal
rather than the temper which struck him as verging on the unnatural or
abnormal. Those who deliberately adopt such an attitude do not usually
admit it to themselves, still less to their victims, and least of all
to a third party. Which may admonish us that Aufidius’ threats were
not deliberate, but mere frantic outcries wrung from him in rage and
mortification. Yet they spring from authentic impulses in his heart,
and though they may for a time be hidden by his superficial chivalry,
they will spread and thrive if the conditions favour their growth. When
they have overrun his nature and choked the wholesome grain, he will
not point to them so openly and will name them by other names. But they
are the same and differ from what they were only as the thorny thicket
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</span>
differs from its parent seeds. They have always been there and it
is well that we should be aware of their presence from the first.
Coleridge concludes his criticism: “However I perceive that in this
speech is meant to be contained a prevention of the shock at the
after-change in Aufidius’ character.” In short, it is not to be taken
as his definite programme from which he inconsistently deviates when
the opportunity is offered at Antium for carrying it out, but as the
involuntary presentiment, which the revealing power of anguish awakens
in his soul, of the crimes he is capable of committing for his master
passion, a presentiment that in the end is realised almost to the letter.</p>

<p>And in the fulfilment, as in the anticipation, he has an eye merely
to the results, and seeks only to obtain the first place for himself
whether he deserve it or no. When Coriolanus consents to the peace with
Rome, Aufidius soliloquises:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At difference in thee: out of that I’ll work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Myself a former fortune.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 200.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is the adventitious superiority and the
judgment by appearances that always appeal to him. Listen to the
interchange of confidences between his accomplice and himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Third Conspirator.</i> The people will remain uncertain whilst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twixt you there’s difference; but the fall of either</div>

    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Aufidius.</i><span class="ws6">I know it:</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And my pretext to strike at him admits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A good construction.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vi. 17.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He will be heir of all, and his action will
admit a good construction; that is enough for him. It only remains to
keep another construction from being suggested; and he approves the
conspirator’s advice:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</span>
It has sometimes been questioned whether such a man would give his
fugitive rival a welcome which at the first and for some time seems so
magnanimous, and if he did, whether the magnanimity was sincere. But
Aufidius, though he is above all a lover of pre-eminence at whatever
cost and therefore cannot for long stand the ordeal of being surpassed,
is not without a soldier’s generosity; and moreover, the course which
he was moved to adopt (and this is a more important consideration)
would be one congenial to his meretricious love of ostentation and
display. There is no rôle more soothing to worsted vanity and at the
same time more likely to gain it the admiration it prizes, than that
of patron to a formerly successful and now unfortunate rival. In the
reflected glory, the benefactor seems to acquire the merits of the
other in addition to a magnificence all his own. This, we may assume,
was in part the motive of Aufidius; as appears from his own words, in
which he shows himself well aware of his own generous behaviour:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">He came unto my hearth;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In all his own desires; nay, let him choose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My best and freshest men; served his designments</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In mine own person; holp to reap the fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which he did end all his; and <i>took some pride</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>To do myself this wrong</i>; till, at the last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I seem’d his follower, not partner, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He waged me with his countenance, as if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I had been mercenary.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vi. 30.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The hasty flash of generosity, the hope of winning
new credit, would soon be extinguished or transmuted by such persistent
success, superiority and pride. And Coriolanus’ popularity with the
troops at the expense of his Volscian colleague, would be bitter to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</span>
most high-minded benefactor. It is brought out to us by his question to
his lieutenant in the camp near Rome: “Do they still fly to the Roman?”
(<span class="smcap">iv.</span> vii. 1). Evidently the soldiers of
Antium flock to the banners of this foreigner rather than to those of
their own countrymen. The suggestion for this is furnished by Plutarch,
but with Shakespeare a sting is added. In the <i>Life</i> Tullus stays
behind as reserve with half the army to guard against any inroad,
while Coriolanus acts on the offensive and captures a number of towns.
Thereupon,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="no-indent">the other Volsces that were
appointed to remaine in garrison for defence of theur countrie, hearing
this good newes, would tary no lenger at home, but armed them selves,
and ranne to Martius campe, saying they dyd acknowledge no other
captaine but him.</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is much less wounding to Aufidius that his men
should wish to exchange inaction for the excitement of war, than that
he should witness their resort to his rival who is, in name, only his
equal in command. Indeed his lieutenant in the play regrets that he did
not do precisely what he did do according to Plutarch.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">I wish, sir,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I mean for your particular,—you had not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Join’d in commission with him; but either</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had borne the action of yourself, or else</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To him had left it solely.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> vii. 12.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thus Shakespeare gives Tullus a stronger motive,
and in so far a better policy for his treason. On the other hand he
bases it more exclusively on personal envy. For in Plutarch the truce
of thirty days which Coriolanus grants Rome is the original occasion
of the movement against him, in which other Volscians besides Aufidius
share; and this movement culminates only after he has conceded peace on
conditions which even Plutarch considers unfair to his employers. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</span>
in the play, as we have seen, the truce is omitted, and Tullus has
determined on the destruction of his supplanter even at a time when he
confidently expects that Rome cannot save herself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">When, Caius, Rome is thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art poor’st of all: then shortly art thou mine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> vii. 56.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thus the last shred of public spirit is torn away
from his selfish ambition and spite.</p>

<p>In contrast with all this lust for precedence and vainglorious egotism,
we cannot but feel that Marcius is striving for the reality of honour
and is eager to fulfil the conditions on which honour is due.</p>

<p>And connected with this is another point which we might regard as the
natural and inevitable consequence, but which Shakespeare only inferred
and did not obtain from Plutarch, who gives no indication of it. This
is Marcius’ indifference to or rather detestation of all professed
praise. His distaste for eulogy does not of course lead him to reject
a distinction and acknowledgment like the surname of <i>Coriolanus</i>
that he is conscious of having deserved. On the contrary he prizes
it and clings to it, and among the circumstances that overthrow his
self-control in the final scene, the fact that Aufidius withholds from
him this appellation has a chief place.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Aufidius.</i><span class="ws8">Marcius!</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Coriolanus.</i><span class="ws10">Marcius!</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Aufidius.</i> Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius; dost thou think</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I’ll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol’n name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Coriolanus in Corioli?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Just in the same way, his aversion from mercantile
profit does not lead him to refuse a gift from a friend when he feels
that he has earned that friend’s approval. So when Cominius bestows on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</span>
him the charger, and bids the host hail him with his new title, he
answers graciously enough if a little awkwardly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I will go wash;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when my face is fair, you shall perceive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whether I blush or no: howbeit I thank you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I mean to stride your steed, and at all times</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To undercrest your good addition</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the fairness of my power.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 68.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But except on such semi-official occasions, which
he is obliged to recognise, any sort of commendation abashes him
and puts him out. Even Lartius’ burst of admiration he immediately
checks:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent11">Pray now, no more: my mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who has a charter to extol her blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When she does praise me, grieves me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 13.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When Cominius persists, he would fain cut him short:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I have some wounds upon me, and they smart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To hear themselves remember’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 28.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">When the host spontaneously breaks out in
acclamation, he feels it is over much, and is more irritated than
pleased:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">May these same instruments, which you profane,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Made all of false-faced soothing!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When steel grows soft as the parasite’s silk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let him be made a coverture for the wars!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No more, I say! For that I have not wash’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My nose that bled, or foil’d some debile wretch,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, without note, here’s many else have done,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You shout me forth</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ix. 42.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So, too, with the welcome of the crowd at his homecoming:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No more of this; it does offend my heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pray now, no more.</div>

</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</span>
Where the formal, and therefore up to a certain point, conventional
panegyrics have to be pronounced in the senate, he is honestly ill at
ease and would rather go away. To the senator who seeks to stay him, he
answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent19">Your honour’s pardon:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I had rather have my wounds to heal again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than hear say how I got them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> ii. 72.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And he adds, as he actually leaves his seat:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I had rather have one scratch my head i’ the sun</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> ii. 79.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He can dispense with the admiration of others,
because he seeks “the perfect witness” of his own approval, and abhors
any extravagant applause because he measures his actions by the
standard of absolute desert. In other words, both his self-respect
and his ideal of attainment are abnormally, one might say morbidly,
developed. And this explains both his humility and his self-assertion.
Volumnia tells him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To imitate the graces of the gods.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 149.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">If that is the goal, how far must even the
mightiest fall short of it, and how much must he resent the adulation
of his prowess as the highest to be attained. On the contrary he “waxes
like the sea,” sets himself to advance</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From well to better, daily self surpassed;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and every glory he achieves is, as Shakespeare
read in Plutarch, less a wage that he has earned than a pledge that he
must redeem.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">It is daylie seene, that honour and reputation
lighting on young men before their time, and before they have no great
corage by nature, the desire to winne more, dieth straight in them,
which easely happeneth, the same having no deepe roote in them before.
Where contrariwise, the first honour that valliant mindes doe come
unto, doth quicken up their appetite, hasting them forward as with
force of winde, to enterprise things of highe deserving praise. For
they esteeme, not to receave reward for service done, but rather take
it for a remembraunce and encoragement, to make them doe better in time
to come: and be ashamed also to cast their honour at their heeles, not
seeking to increase it still by like deserte of worthie valliant dedes.
This desire being bred in Martius, he strained still to passe him selfe
in manlines: and being desirous to shewe a daylie increase of his
valliantnes, his noble service dyd still advaunce his fame.</p>

<p class="no-indent">But, on the other hand, though he, as not having
attained, presses forward to the mark of his high calling, he has but
to spend a glance on his fellows, and being an honest man he must
perceive that his performance quite eclipses theirs. When the citizen
asks him what has brought him to stand for the consulship, his reply
is from the heart: “Mine own desert” (<span class="smcap">ii.</span>
iii. 71). He feels poignantly the indignity of having to ask for what
seems to him his due, and this partly explains the reluctance, which
Shakespeare invents for him, to face a popular election.</p>

<p>And he is entitled to this consciousness of his worth, for it is not
merely individual. It collects in a focus the most valued traits of
various social fellowships that are greater and wider than himself. He
is—he has been taught to consider himself and to become—the peculiar
representative of the great family of the great aristocracy of the
great city of Rome. If he transcends the dimensions of ordinary human
power and human error, this consideration enables us to see how he has
come to do so, and brings him back to our ordinary human sympathies.
These are the three concentric orbits in which his universe revolves,
the three well-heads that feed the current of his life. They give
impetus to his love of honour and volume to his pride.</p>

<p>His civic patriotism he lives to abjure, but at first it is eager and
intense. It is this feeling that is affronted by the retreat of his
townsmen before Corioli and that boils over in curses and abuse: he
is wroth with them because they are “shames of Rome.” The climax to
his appeal for volunteers is to ask if any thinks “that his country’s
dearer than himself” (<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> vi. 72): and
in the moment of triumph he classes himself unreservedly among all his
comrades who have been actuated by his own and the only right motive,
love for the <i>patria</i>.</p>

<p>But the domestic tie is the closest of all. The whole story brings
out its compulsive pressure and no particular passages are needed to

<p class="no-indent">It is as son, husband and father that the depths
of Coriolanus’ nature can be reached. In his greetings to his wife, in
his prayers for his boy, we have glimpses of his inward heart; but of
course this family feeling is concentrated on his mother who, as it
were, sums up his ancestry to him, and who, by her personal qualities
and her parental authority, fills his soul with a kind of religious
reverence. We have seen how she has fashioned him, how she commands
and awes him. When she inclines her head as she appears before him, he
already feels that it is incongruous and absurd:</p>

<p>Not only then is Coriolanus in other respects a singularly noble
personality, but even his pride is certainly not devoid of ethical
content when it embodies the consciousness of the city republic, the
governing estate, the organised family, with all their claims and
obligations. These are the constituent elements that have supplied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</span>
matter for his self-esteem, and all of them are formative, and capable,
as we saw, of producing such a lofty, though limited moral character
as that of Volumnia. Yet it is precisely to them, or at least to the
way in which they are mingled in his pride, that Coriolanus’ faults and
misfortunes may be traced.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="h_subtitle">THE DISASTERS OF CORIOLANUS<br /> AND THEIR CAUSES</span></h3>
</div>

<p>Feeling for his country, feeling for his caste, feeling for his family
thus form the triple groundwork of Coriolanus’ nobleness, but they fail
to uphold it in the storm of temptation. As furnishing the foundations
of conduct they have dangers and defects, inherent in themselves, or
incident to their combination, and these it is to which the guilt and
ruin of Coriolanus are due.</p>

<p>These drawbacks may be illustrated under three heads. They are unfit
completely to transfigure egoism, for they have all an egoistic aspect,
and are indeed merely extended forms of selfishness. They are primarily
the products of nature, instinct, passion; and may exist without being
raised to the rank of rational principles and without having their
just scope delimited and defined. And, lastly, for that reason their
relative importance may be mistaken, and one that is the stronger
natural impulse may usurp the place of one that is of more binding
moral authority.</p>

<p>It has often been pointed out, and sometimes as a matter of complaint,
that family affection is very restricted in its range and may conflict
with the larger interests of mankind. It produces an intense unity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</span>
within the one household, but it is apt to be jealous, repellent,
aggressive as regards other households and their members. Further,
in so far as it is <i>my</i> parents, <i>my</i> brothers, <i>my</i>
children, whose welfare I promote, the ground of preference has nothing
to do with impartial equity: it is determined by the nearness of the
persons to <i>me</i>, by <i>my</i> fondness for them, by my looking on
them as appurtenances of <i>mine</i>; in short it is selfish. And those
who maintain the sacredness of the family give this no absolute denial,
but reply, first, that in the long run the true interests of one
family, rightly understood, do not conflict with the true interests of
other families, of the state, or the rest of mankind; and, second, that
even before the true interests are rightly grasped, the family relation
forms at least a stage in the process by which the individual learns to
enlarge his self-interest, a preliminary stage but an inevitable stage,
and still for the vast majority of men the stage of most practical
importance. Many a one is ready to give up his personal pleasure or
advantage for those of his own house, who would be deaf to all more
general appeals. Thus the family so widens self-love as to include in
it some other people, but in one of its aspects it nevertheless depends
on self-love.</p>

<p>And the same thing holds good of the enlarged kindred that we call an
aristocracy. The nobility of blood forms a sort of family on a large
scale, a family of caste, an amplified household united by common
pursuits, privileges, education and ideals, and often further blended
by frequent intermarriage. The aristocrat finds himself born into this
artificial, which is in some respects almost like a natural fraternity;
and his ethos to his order, ethos though it be, is largely the ethos of
the individual who recognises his own reflection in his fellow nobles.</p>

<p>Nor is it otherwise with the state, especially, we may say, the antique
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</span>
city state, where often the aristocracy really was the native nucleus,
and which in the greatest expansion of which it was capable, did not
exceed the dimensions of a modern municipality. The patriotism of the
citizens had the fervour of domestic piety, their disputes had the
bitterness of family quarrels. In the community its sons exulted and
lived and moved and had their being: it was theirs and they were its,
in opposition to the alien states, the states of other people, to which
they were apt to be indifferent or hostile.</p>

<p>Now it is evident that all these principles in the case of a man with
a strong consciousness of his own worth and superlative self-respect,
might give substance and validity to his egoism, but would rather
encourage than counteract it. And so with Coriolanus. His independent,
individual, isolated sufficiency passes all bounds. He derives
sustenance for it from the three layers of atmosphere that envelope
him, but he thinks he can if necessary dispense with these external
aids. In so far as he can separate the people in his mind from the
whole body politic of Rome, he excludes them from his sympathy, or even
his tolerance, and glories in his ostentation of antagonism. Take his
speech about the popular demonstration:</p>

<p class="no-indent">In reference to this Archbishop Trench has a very

division of ranks,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">[proverbs] may go nearly or quite out of use among
the so-called upper classes. No gentleman, says Lord Chesterfield,
“ever uses a proverb.” And with how true a touch of nature, Shakespeare
makes Coriolanus, the man who with all his greatness, is entirely
devoid of all sympathy with the people, to utter his scorn of them in
scorn of their proverbs and of their frequent employment of them.</p>

<p class="no-indent">But it is characteristic of this spirit which
really makes a man a law to himself and the measure of things, that
though by all his training and prejudices inclined to the traditional
and conservative in politics, yet, if use-and-wont presses hard against
his own pride, he shows himself an innovator of the most uncompromising
kind. He objects once and again to the prescriptive forms of election,

<p class="no-indent">Here he blossoms out as the reddest of radicals,
though a radical of the Napoleonic type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</span>
But, further, his feeling for family, class and country is
pre-eminently feeling. It belongs to those natural tendencies that
almost seem to come to us by heredity and environment, and have
analogies with the instincts of animals. It is, at least in the form
it assumes with him, not to be ranked among the moral convictions
which can stand the examination of conscience and reason, and in the
production of which conscience and reason have co-operated. It is
rather an innate impulse, a headlong passion, and resembles a blind
physical force of which he can give no account. His understanding is
without right of entry into this part of his life. We have seen, no
doubt, that his presuppositions once granted he can form a very acute
estimate of the situation. But he never uses his judgment either
in examining his presuppositions or in discovering the treatment
that the situation requires. He has not the width of outlook or the
self-criticism that enable Menenius and Cominius, and even the ordinary
senators, to see the relative importance of the principles for which
they contend, and prefer any compromise to laying the city flat and
sacking great Rome with Romans. He has not the astuteness of Volumnia,
who perceives that strategy is to be used in government as in war and
bids him stoop to conquer:</p>

<p class="no-indent">Both in regard to end and means, he listens to the
counsels not of his reason but of his passion and hot blood. As how
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</span>
could he do otherwise? It is passion not reason that oversways his
nature, determining everything in him from these first fundamental
principles to the most transitory mood. More particularly, that
tyrannous self-respect of his, the personal flame in which all his
interests, domestic, aristocratic, national, are fused, is his central
passion, and one that gives more heat than light. Sometimes, indeed,
it kindles him to great things. When the Volscian army abandons the
shelter of Corioli he feels it an insult to his country, therefore to
himself; and the outrage to his <i>amour propre</i> incites him to do wonders.</p>

<p class="no-indent">He was justified in objecting to methods of
dissimulation and flattery, but, if only he had been reasonable, a
middle course would not have been hard to find, which should safeguard
his self-respect while pacifying the populace. It is because his
self-respect is of passion not of reason, that he is so unconciliatory,
and therefore almost as culpable as if he were guilty of the opposite
fault. Plutarch, indeed, thinks he is more so. In his comparison between
him and Alcibiades, he is in this matter more lenient to the latter:</p>

<p class="blockquot">He is lesse to be blamed, that seeketh to please
and gratifie his common people; then he that despiseth and disdaineth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</span>
them, and therefore offereth them wrong and injurie, bicause he would
not seeme to flatter them, to winne the more authoritie. For as it is
an evill thing to flatter the common people to winne credit; even so
it is besides dishonesty, and injustice also, to atteine to credit
and authoritie, for one to make him selfe terrible to the people, by
offering them wrong and violence.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">As he hath spices of them all, not all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I dare so far free him—made him fear’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So hated, and so banish’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> vii. 35.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But, lastly, not only are the three objective ethical principles that
give Coriolanus his moral equipment, inadequate in so far as their
range is largely selfish and their origin largely natural; he misplaces
the order in which they should come. In the case of Volumnia, despite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</span>
all her maternal preference and patrician prejudice, Rome is the grand
consideration, as her deeds unequivocally prove. Nor is she singular;
she is only the most conspicuous example among others of her caste.
Cominius, too, postpones the family to the state:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">I do love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My country’s good with a respect more tender,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More holy and profound, than mine own life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My dear wife’s estimate, her womb’s increase,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And treasure of my loins.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> iii. 111.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And this is more or less the attitude of the
rest. But Coriolanus reverses the sequence, and gives his chief homage
precisely to the most restricted and elementary, the most primitive
and instinctive principle of the three. He loves Rome indeed, fights
for her, grieves for her shames, and glories in her triumphs; but he
loves the nobility more, and would by wholesale massacre secure their
supremacy. He loves the nobility indeed, but when they, no doubt for
the common good, suffer him to be expelled from Rome, they become to
him the “dastard nobles”; and he makes hardly any account of his old
henchman and intimate Menenius, and none at all of his old comrade and
general Cominius. But he loves his family as himself, and though he
strives to root out its claims from his heart, the attempt is vain. He
may exclaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Out, affection!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All bond and privilege of nature, break!</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 24.)</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">I’ll never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As if a man were author of himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And knew no other kin.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 34.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But it is mere histrionic make-believe and
pretence: at the first words of Virgilia he cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">Like a dull actor now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have forgot my part, and I am out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even to a full disgrace.</div>
    <div class="verse indent25">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 40.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</span>
How could this man, whose personal pride and family pride are
so interwoven, whose self-love and whose virtues are so much an
inheritance of his line, ever hope to sever himself from what makes up
his very being? The home instincts must triumph.</p>

<p>It is well that they should, and this is the redeeming touch that
cancels much of the guilt of apostasy which brands the close of his
career. But all the same we feel that his self-surrender to the
obligations of the family is a less noble thing than his mother’s
self-surrender to the obligations of the state. Of course, in a way,
family and class must with all come before the whole community. Men,
that is, are bound to be more interested in those of their own circle
and their own set than in their fellow-citizens with whom they have
less relation. That gives a very good ground for a man’s constant
unremitting occupation with his nearest and dearest. But, nevertheless,
when the call comes, it is the wider community that has the more
imperative claim.</p>

<p>And it is easy to see that Volumnia, though at the supreme moment
she shows that she herself has the right feeling for the relation,
is responsible for the inverted order in the conception of her son.
Her contempt for the masses, her exaltation of the patricians, her
high-handed insistence on the family authority were almost bound to be
exaggerated in a child growing up under her influence and subjected
to no corrective views. And she must have added to the dangers of her
tuition by dangling before his eyes the ideal personal honour as the
grand prize of life. He wins it and lets it slip again and again, and
when he grasps it at last, it is rent and mangled in his hands. There
is something typical in the episode of his son and the butterfly, as
Valeria narrates it:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>I saw him run after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it, he
let it go again; and after it again; and over and over he comes, and up
again; catched it again; or whether his fall enraged him, or how ’twas,
he did so set his teeth and tear it: Ο, I warrant, how he mammocked it!</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iii. 65.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Young Marcius is described as the facsimile and
“epitome” of his father, and Volumnia is well pleased with this example
of the family bent. She must not disclaim her share in the preparation,
when the father enacts the apologue in the larger theatre of life.</p>

<p>And she is even responsible for some of the mistaken courses that
directly lead to the disaster.</p>

<p>For Coriolanus, with all his blind sides and rough corners, might still
be the faithful and honoured champion of Rome if he were left to follow
his own predestined and congenial path as military leader. In the field
he can rouse the courage of the citizens and fire their enthusiasm,
while on his part, when he wins their recognition and devotion, he
lays aside some of his asperity to them, and is even gracious in his
awkward, convincing way. They forget their hatred, he forgets his
scorn. And to him as warrior the whole population, not only the portion
of it that has the franchise, is ready to do honour. The description
which the chagrined tribune gives of his triumphal progress through
the streets shows with what cordial pride all ranks were eager to pay
him homage. There is no reason why he should not continue to discharge
in this his proper sphere the functions that none could discharge so
well. His political weight is from the first small. Despite his urgent
dissuasion he has been powerless to prevent the distribution of corn
or the concession of the tribunate. And when he does not intrude into
this outlying domain, where he effects nothing, he seems to go his own
way peaceably enough, occupied mainly in watching for the common good
the movements of Aufidius and the Volscians; so that, so far as his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</span>
antipathy to the people is concerned, his bark is worse than his bite.
That is the point of the similes that Brutus and Menenius exchange
about him when Menenius has compared the plebs to a wolf and Coriolanus
to a lamb. Says the tribune:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And the senator answers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He’s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> i. 12.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But thrust him into a position that involves
political authority, and all will be changed. It will be impossible
for him to confine himself to harmless growls; the bear will have the
people in his hug, and they are not to blame if they take to their
weapons. In short the antagonism, which before was, so to speak,
academic and led to nothing, must become a matter of life and death.
Now it must not be overlooked that it is in obedience to his mother’s
ambitions and in opposition to his own better judgment that Coriolanus
stands for the consulship. Of course, in a way, it is the natural
goal of his career. Even Menenius is so blinded by the glamour of the
situation that he interposes no prudent warning. Nevertheless, if he
had only exercised his accustomed shrewdness he would have seen the
mischievousness of such a course; for in a remark to the tribune he
sums up admirably the perils it involves:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">He loves your people;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But tie him not to be their bedfellow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> ii. 68.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">yet for all that, Menenius is the candidate’s
most active electioneering agent. When his sagacity so neglects its
own suggestions, it is perhaps not wonderful that Volumnia’s narrower
intellect should ignore everything but her visions of glory for herself
and her son. And yet she might have laid to heart his sincere remonstrance:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">Know, good mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I had rather been their servant in my way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than sway with them in theirs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">iI.</span> i. 218.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">She cannot be acquitted of driving him into the
false position.</p>

<p>And she is equally responsible for the fiasco and disaster in which his
attempted submission ends. Observe that this is not the only course he
might have adopted. Cominius, entering in the middle of the discussion,
suggests two others:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I have been i’ the market-place; and, sir, ’tis fit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You make strong party, or defend yourself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By calmness or by absence.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> ii. 93.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The first expedient of making strong party and
resorting to force is out of the question, both because, as Cominius
has already pointed out, it is practically hopeless in face of the
odds, and because, as he and others have also pointed out, even if
successful it would ruin the state. The second expedient of calmness
and conciliation is the one that Volumnia and Menenius in their
pertinacious craving to see Coriolanus consul, strongly advocate; and
in the abstract it is the right one. But it suffers from a drawback
which makes it worse than hopeless, and which Cominius has the
foresight to recognise. “Only fair speech,” says Menenius, and Cominius
rejoins very doubtfully:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">I <i>think</i> ’t will serve, <i>if</i> he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can thereto frame his spirit.</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> ii. 95.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">That is just the point; and one wonders how anyone
who knew Coriolanus could expect of him so impossible a feat. There
remains the expedient of absence, which Cominius, from the third place
he assigns to it, himself seems to prefer. And in the circumstances it
is obviously the best. If only the accused had withdrawn for a time, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</span>
would soon have been recalled. It is inconceivable that when the new
expedition of the Volscians, which he alone foresaw, broke into Roman
territory, the state would not at once have had recourse to the great
commander. Nor would there have been much difficulty in doing so,
since he would merely have betaken himself to voluntary retirement;
and even had he been exiled in default, the mutual exasperation on
both sides, which the last collision was to produce, would have been
avoided. But again it is Volumnia’s overbearing self-will that imposes
on him the pernicious choice. And though, as I have said, this proposal
is ideally the best, for in such cases management and compromise are
legitimate enough and may be laudable, it is not only the worst in
the present instance, but she gives it a turn that must have made it
peculiarly revolting to her son. In her covetousness for the consular
dignity she recommends such hypocrisy, trickery and base cringing as the
self-respect of no honest man, much less of a Coriolanus, could tolerate:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">I prithee now, my son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thus far having stretch’d it—here be with them—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy knee bussing the stones—for in such business</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">More learned than the ears—waving thy head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now humble as the ripest mulberry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that will not hold the handling: or say to them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> ii. 72.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">The amicable policy need not have been painted
in such colours as these. It is inevitable that Coriolanus, already
inclined to regard it as a degradation, should after these words
construe it in the most humiliating-sense:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent25">Well, I must do’t:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away, my disposition, and possess me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some harlot’s spirit! My throat of war be turn’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which quired with my drum, into a pipe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Make motion through my lips, and my arm’d knees,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who bow’d but in the stirrup, bend like his</div>

    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> ii. 110.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">What wonder that his conclusion is to reject
such tactics lest they should dishonour his integrity and degrade his
soul? His mother’s anger indeed makes him abandon this decision, but
his instincts are right. It is a part that of course he could not
play under any circumstances, but she has done nothing to show it in
its more honourable aspect, and everything to confirm and increase
his feeling of its vileness. His sourness and recalcitrance at being
false to himself makes him boil over the more fiercely at the first
provocation, and all is lost.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that defeat and the desire for vengeance teach
him the lessons which his mother had inculcated in vain, and that
henceforth he shows himself a master of dissimulation, flattery, and
deception. In proof of this it is usual to cite, in the first place,
the farewell scene, when he breathes no word to Cominius, Menenius,
Virgilia, or Volumnia of his intention to join the Volscians and return
to overthrow Rome. But was any such intention as yet in his mind? In
Plutarch he has adopted no definite plan before he sets out. After
telling how he comforts his family, the biography proceeds:</p>

<p class="blockquot">He went immediatly to the gate of the cittie,
accompanied with a great number of Patricians that brought him thither,
from whence he went on his waye with three or foure of his friendes
only, taking nothing with him, nor requesting any thing of any man. So
he remained a fewe dayes in the countrie at his houses, turmoyled with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</span>
sundry sortes and kynde of thoughtes, suche as the fyer of his choller
dyd sturre up. In the ende, seeing he could resolve no waye, to take a
profitable or honorable course, but only was pricked forward still to
be revenged of the Romaines, he thought to raise up some great warres
against them, by their neerest neighbours.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Of course it is quite true, and it has been one
purpose of this essay to show, that Shakespeare often completely
recasts Plutarch. But it is also true that, when he does not expressly
do so, he often keeps Plutarch’s statements in his mind, even when, as
in the case of the voting by tribes, he does not cite them. It counts
for something then, that in the <i>Life</i>, Coriolanus on leaving
Rome has no fixed purpose of seeking foreign help. And if we turn to
the parting scene in the tragedy, and let it make its own impression,
without reading into it suggestions from subsequent occurrences, I
think we feel not so much that he is still undecided as that the idea
has not yet entered into his head. We seem to hear the very accent of
sincerity in his repetition of the maxims that erewhile he learned from
his mother’s own lips, and that he clinches with the reminder:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">You were used to load me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With precepts that would make invincible</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The heart that conn’d them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> i. 9.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Surely it is a real attempt at consolation, when
he interrupts her maledictions on the plebeians who have banished him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">What, what, what!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I shall be loved, when I am lack’d.</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> i. 14.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He seems to hint at seeking out new adventures and
a new career in new regions beyond the reach of Rome, when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">My mother, you wot well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My hazards still have been your solace: and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Believe’t not lightly—though I go alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Makes fear’d and talk’d of more than seen—your son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will or exceed the common or be caught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With cautelous baits and practice.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> i. 27.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</span>
It was not cautelous baits and practice that he would have to fear,
but the open violence of Aufidius if he already thought of going to
Antium, and the simile of the lonely dragon more talked of than seen
would be abundantly inappropriate if it referred to his reappearance
at the head of the Volscian forces: but the expressions would be quite
apt if he meant to make his name redoubtable by his single prowess in
strange places amidst the risks of an errant life. It is in professed
anticipation of this that he rejects the companionship which Cominius
offers:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the wars’ surfeits, to go rove with one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That’s yet unbruised.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> i. 45.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Are these utterances mere pretence? And have not
his last farewells the genuine note of cordiality and good will? If
we could imagine that he would bring himself to address those whom he
afterwards called the “dastard nobles” as “my friends of noble touch,”
it would still be impossible to believe him guilty of cold-hearted
deceit to Virgilia and Volumnia.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My friends of noble touch, when I am forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While I remain above the ground, you shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear from me still, and never of me aught</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But what is like me formerly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> i. 48.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It would not be like the former champion of Rome
to return as its assailant; but we may take it that at this moment he
is expecting to carve his way to glory in a different world and perhaps
eventually be recalled to his country, but in any case to proceed
merely on the old lines in so far as that is possible, and meanwhile
to be reported of, as Menenius continues, “worthily as any ear can hear.”</p>

<p>If, then, he is speaking honestly in this scene, how are we to account
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</span>
for his change of purpose when we next meet him a renegade in Antium?
No explanation was needed in Plutarch, for the circumstances were not
quite the same. There he had only not resolved to join the enemy; here
he apparently has resolved to do something else. In the <i>Life</i>
after leaving the city he merely comes to a decision, in the play he
reverses the decision he has formed. So some statement is needed of
the cause for the alteration of his plans, and at first sight there
seems to be none. Yet there is a hint and a fairly emphatic one,
though it has not been worked out; a hint, moreover, which is the more
significant that it is one of Shakespeare’s interpolations.</p>

<p>When the sentence of banishment is pronounced and Coriolanus has
retired to his house, there follows a passage which has no parallel or
foundation in Plutarch. It is the one already referred to in another
connection in which Sicinius gives his mean and malicious order to the
people:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he hath follow’d you, with all despite:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give him deserved vexation.</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> iii. 138.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And the citizens promptly agree:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, come; let’s see him out at gates; come.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">iII.</span> iii. 141.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is at the very close of the Third Act, and
the Fourth Act begins in “Rome, before a gate of the city” with the
scene of leave-taking discussed above. We naturally expect that it will
be interrupted by the popular demonstrations which the tribunes have
contrived, especially as these exist only in Shakespeare’s imagination;
but it passes off without any hint of them. Only patrician persons
appear by whom Coriolanus is beloved and who are beloved by him: and no
hostile murmur jars on the solemnity of their grief. But that does not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</span>
mean that it may not do so even now. He is not yet beyond the walls,
and towards the close bids his friends: “Bring me out at gate”; which,
we assume, they do forthwith. There is still time for the plebeians to
execute their masters’ orders, and though we witness nothing of the
kind, there is no reason to believe that they failed to do so. It is
easy to conjecture why Shakespeare thought it unnecessary to present
this incident to eye and ear. It would have disturbed the quiet dignity
of the parting interview; it would have repeated at a lower pitch,
without the accompaniment of suspense, and therefore with the risk of
monotony and flatness, the tumultuary <i>motif</i> of preceding scenes.
But Shakespeare’s variations from his authority are not idle, and we
cannot suppose that the tribune’s direction, though we do not actually
see it carried out, was a meaningless tag. There is room enough in the
economy of the play for its fulfilment beyond the stage. We may imagine
that just as Coriolanus’ friends proceed to “bring him out at gate”
the insulting irruption takes place; and in the next scene, “a street
near the gate,” we find the tribunes, the work done, dismissing their agents:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Bid them all home; he’s gone, and we’ll no further.</div>
    <div class="verse indent33">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> ii. i.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It seems probable that this last indignity, a
hurt to his pride more galling than any refusal of office or sentence
of banishment, drives Coriolanus to his fury of vindictiveness; and
that the failure of the nobles to protect him from the outrage has in
his eyes confounded them with his more ignoble enemies. Indeed, he
almost says as much in his speech to Aufidius. In that speech, as we
have seen, Shakespeare adheres more closely to North than in any other
continuous passage in the play, and the greatest variation occurs in a
line that would apply with peculiar aptness to the purely Shakespearian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</span>
episode of the last affront, and that sets forth the main cause of the
exile’s resentment. In Plutarch, after saying that only the surname of
Coriolanus remains to him, he continues:</p>

<p class="blockquot">The rest the envie and crueltie of the people of
Rome have taken from me, by the sufferance of the dastardly nobilitie
and magistrates, who have forsaken me, and let me be
banished by the people.</p>

<p class="no-indent">This becomes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The cruelty and envy of the people,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Permitted by our dastard nobles, who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have all forsook me, hath devour’d the rest:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>And suffer’d me by the voice of slaves to be</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Whoop’d out of Rome</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> v. 80.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Considering all these things there seems to be no
evidence in Marcius’ parting professions of acquired duplicity.</p>

<p>But, again, it is said that for his revenge he condescends to fawn upon
Aufidius and the Volscians. This is not very plausible. His speech of
greeting certainly shows no servile propitiation, and according to
Tullus it is conspicuously absent in his subsequent behaviour:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent12">He bears himself more proudlier,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even to my person, than I thought he would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When first I did embrace him: yet his nature</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In that’s no changeling; and I must excuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What cannot be amended.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> vii. 8.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And elsewhere Tullus complains that his guest
has “waged him with his countenance.” The only ground for saying that
he paid court to the Volsces is alleged in Tullus’ speech that just
precedes this accusation of haughtiness to himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He water’d his new plants with dews of flattery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bow’d his nature, never known before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But to be rough, unswayable and free.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vi. 23.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But the speaker is an enemy, and an enemy who has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</span>
to account for the disagreeable circumstance that his own adherents
have gone over to his rival, and who, moreover, at the time is looking
for a plea that “admits of good construction.” There is nothing that
we see or hear of Coriolanus elsewhere that supports the charge. We
are told, indeed, that the Volscians throng to him and do him homage.
The very magnates of Antium, Aufidius included, treat him like a demi-god:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son and heir to
Mars; set at upper end o’ the table: no question asked by any of the
senators, but they stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him; sanctifies himself with ’s hand and turns up the white
o’ the eye to his discourse.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> v. 203.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Recruits throng to his standard and the army
worships him. The Lieutenant tells Aufidius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I do not know what witchcraft’s in him, but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your soldiers use him as the grace ’fore meat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their talk at table, and their thanks at end.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> vii. 2.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Doubtless this enthusiasm would have its effect
on Marcius. Eagerness of service, coupled with confidence in himself,
has before now warmed him to graciousness, and in his own despite wrung
from him inspiring compliments. When at Cominius’ camp before Corioli
the volunteers crowded round him, waved their swords, and took him up
in their arms, he was almost hyperbolical in his praises:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O, me alone! make you a sword of me?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If these shows be not outward, which of you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But is four Volsces? none of you but is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Able to bear against the great Aufidius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shield as hard as his.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> vi. 76.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">So we may well believe that his soldierly spirit
would respond promptly and lavishly when the Volscians rallied round
him. But such appreciation, however his outstripped competitor might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</span>
interpret it, would have nothing in common with the arts of the
sycophant and the time-server; nor is there anything else in
Coriolanus’ conduct that explains or confirms ever so slightly the
charge of the interested and envious Aufidius.</p>

<p>On the contrary he remains true, and even too true, to his original
nature. It is the outrage on his self-respect that drives him to the
Volscians, and his self-respect still gives the law to his life, and
would forbid all petty vices, though it enjoins heroic crime. A man
like this could not be expected to palliate or overlook the profanation
of his cherished dignity. The passion of pride at his ear, he sets
himself to rupture all weaker ties of passion or instinct. And yet he
himself is half aware of his mistake, and he has to fortify himself in
his obstinate perversity. This is shown in two ways: first, he has a
smothered sense of the inadequacy of his justification; and, second, he
cannot with all his efforts be quite consistent in his revenge.</p>

<p>Of his repressed feeling that the offence does not excuse the
retaliation, we have repeated confessions on his part, all the more
striking that they are involuntary and perhaps unconscious. Thus, just
after he has sought out the enemy of his country, he soliloquises:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Are still together, who twin, as ’twere, in love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unseparable, shall within this hour,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On a dissension of a doit, break out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To take the one the other, by some chance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And interjoin their issues. So with me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My birth-place hate I, and my love’s upon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This enemy town.</div>
    <div class="verse indent32">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> iv. 12.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</span>
Here he acknowledges that his change of sides has the most trivial
occasion. Friends fall out on a dissension of a doit while foes are
reconciled for some trick not worth an egg; and he applies this
principle to his own case: “So with me.” After all he has infinitely
more in common with the Romans than he can ever have in common with the
Volscians, infinitely more reason for hating this enemy town than he
can ever have for hating his own birth-place.</p>

<p>Or again, when on the point of dismissing Menenius, he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">That we have been familiar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Than pity note how much.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 91.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He admits, then, that his wilful oblivion is
“ingrate,” and realises that pity would consider the old relations.</p>

<p>Or, once more, almost at the close, when he feels himself in danger of
yielding to the voice of nature, he utters the truculent prayer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Let it be virtuous to be obstinate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent19">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 26.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">which implies that he knew it was not.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with all his doggedness, he cannot be quite
consequent in his rancour. He may lead her foes against his “thankless
country” as he calls it, but he has a lurking kindliness even for the
Rome he thinks he detests. As we learn from Aufidius’ speech:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">Although it seems,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so he thinks, and is no less apparent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whene’er we come to our account.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">iV.</span> vii. 19.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is no doubt suggested by the incident of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</span>
thirty days’ truce, of which Plutarch makes so much and which
Shakespeare totally suppresses. But the vague reference becomes all
the more pregnant, when we are to understand that Coriolanus has at
unawares and against his purpose granted some little concessions to the
victims of his wrath. That Aufidius’ statement has some foundation, is
made probable by the words of the First Antium Lord, who is no enemy to
Marcius, but reproaches Tullus with his murder and reverently bewails
his death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What faults he made before the last, I think,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might have found easy fines.</div>
    <div class="verse indent27">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vi. 64.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Faults, then, from the Volscian point of view he has committed in the
opinion of a sympathetic and impartial onlooker: which means that as a
Roman he has shown forbearance.</p>

<p>So much for the toll that he pays to his patriotism; but neither can
he quite uproot the old associations with his class. He may denounce
the “dastard nobles,” but he does concede something to Menenius, the
patrician whose aristocratic prejudices are most akin to his own:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent15">Their latest refuge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was to send him; for whose old love I have,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though I show’d sourly to him, once more offer’d</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The first conditions, which they did refuse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And cannot now accept: to grace him only</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That thought he could do more, <i>a very little</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>I have yielded to</i>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 11.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And, coming to the chief in his trinity of
interests, he may seek to break all bond and privilege of nature and
refuse to be such a gosling to obey instinct, but the natural instinct
of the family is too strong for him; before it his resolution crumbles
to pieces, though he foresees the result.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent15">O mother, mother!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But for your son,—believe it, O, believe it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Most dangerously you have with him prevail’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If not most mortal to him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 182.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Still this collapse of Coriolanus’ purpose means nothing more than
the victory of his strongest impulse. There is no acknowledgment
of offence, there is no renovation of character, there is not even
submission to the highest force within his experience. Our admiration
of his surrender is not unmixed. It is a moving spectacle to see a
man, despite all the solicitations of wrath and revenge, of interest
and fear, obedient to what is on the whole so salutary an influence
as domestic affection. But loyalty to this will not of itself avail
to safeguard anyone from criminal entanglements, or to equip him for
beneficent public action, or to change the current of his life. It
may mean the triumph of a natural tendency that happens to be good
over other natural tendencies that happen to be bad, but it does not
mean acceptance of duty as duty, or anxiety to satisfy the claims
that different duties impose. Hence Coriolanus, to the very end,
leaves unredeemed his inherited obligations to Rome, while he leaves
unfulfilled his voluntary pledges to his allies. Even in Plutarch’s
narrative Shakespeare’s insight is not required to detect this
underlying thought, but in the <i>Comparison</i>, which there is proof
that Shakespeare had studied, it is set forth so clearly that he who
runs may read.</p>

<p class="blockquot">He made the Volsces (of whome he was generall) to
lose the oportunity of noble victory. Where in deede he should (if he
had done as he ought) have withdrawen his armie with their counsaill
and consent, that had reposed so great affiance in him, in making him
their generall: if he had made that accompt of them, as their good will
towards him did in duety binde him. Or else, if he did not care for the
Volsces in the enterprise of this warre, but had only procured it of
intent to be revenged, and afterwards to leave it of, when his anger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</span>
was blowen over; yet he had no reason for the love of his mother to
pardone his contrie; but rather he should in pardoning his contrie have
spared his mother, bicause his mother and wife were members of the
bodie of his contrie and cittie, which he did besiege. For in that he
uncurteously rejected all publike petitions ... to gratifie only the
request of his mother in his departure; that was no acte so much to
honour his mother with, as to dishonour his contrie by, the which was
preserved for the pitie and intercession of a woman, and not for the
love of it selfe, as if it had not bene worthie of it. And so was this
departure a grace, to say truly, very odious and cruell, and deserved
no thanks of either partie, to him that did it. For he withdrew his
army, not at the request of the Romaines, against whom he made warre:
nor with their consent, at whose charge the warre was made.</p>

<p class="no-indent">That Shakespeare, with his patriotism and equity,
perceived the double flaw in Coriolanus’ act of grace can hardly be
doubted. He was the last man to put the household above the national
gods, or to glorify breach of contract if only it were sanctioned by
domestic tenderness. In point of fact, he does not acquit his hero on
either count.</p>

<p>On the one hand, if Coriolanus remits the extreme penalty, he neither
forgets nor forgives, and has no thought of return to the offending
city or resumption of the old ties. Scarcely has he granted the ladies
their boon, when he addresses Aufidius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent18">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 197.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">And his speech to the senators of Antium shows no
revival of former loyalties:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Hail, lords! I am return’d your soldier,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Than shame to the Romans.</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vi. 71.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</span>
The insolent announcement of the invasion carried to the gates of the
capital, of the plunder that substantially exceeds the cost, of the
humiliating terms imposed on his countrymen, is ample proof that in
Coriolanus there is no recrudescence of patriotism.</p>

<p>Yet, despite his words, he has been false to the Volscians. However
base were his motives, Aufidius speaks the truth when he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent24">Perfidiously</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He has betray’d your business, and given up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I say “your city,” to his wife and mother;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breaking his oath and resolution like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A twist of rotten silk, never admitting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Counsel o’ the war.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vi. 91.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">It is the opinion of the First Lord, despite his
impartiality and his sympathy with Marcius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent21">There to end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where he was to begin, and give away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The benefit of our levies, answering us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With our own charge; making a treaty where</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a yielding,—this admits no excuse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> vi. 65.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thus both his native and his adopted country have
reason to complain. He remains a traitor to the one, while yet he
breaks faith with the other.</p>

<p>Of course, in theory there was a middle course possible, which would
have served the best interests of the two states equally. He might have
used his influence to establish a lasting and intimate alliance; and
this was the policy that Volumnia outlined in her plea:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If it were so that our request did tend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To save the Romans, thereby to destroy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As poisonous to your honour: no; our suit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is, that you reconcile them: while the Volsces</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">May say, “This mercy we have show’d”; the Romans,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“This we received”; and each in either side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give the all-hail to thee, and cry “Be blest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For making up this peace!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii. 132.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</span>
But such an all-hail was not for Coriolanus to win. It is one of the
charges which Plutarch brings against him in the <i>Comparison</i>,
that he neglected the opportunity.</p>

<p class="blockquot">By this dede of his he tooke not away the enmity
that was betwene both people.</p>

<p class="no-indent">But how could he, when he had no special desire
for the well-being of either, and when his heart was unchanged? His
family affection has got the better of his narrower egoism, but even
after sacrificing a portion of his revenge, he remains essentially
the man he was, and is no more capable of pursuing a judicious and
conciliatory policy now for the good of the whole and his own good,
than of old in the market-place of Rome.</p>

<p>For to the end he is imprudent, headstrong, and violent as ever. He
sees quite clearly that his compliance with his mother’s prayer must be
dangerous, if not mortal, to him. Dangerous it is, mortal it need not
be. With a little more self-restraint and circumspection, a little less
aggressiveness and truculence, he might still preserve both his life
and his authority. It is his unchastened spirit, not the questionable
treaty, that is the direct cause of his death. Indeed, in a sense,
the treaty had nothing to do with it. In Shakespeare, though not in
Plutarch, Tullus, as we have seen, when he still anticipated the
capture of Rome, determined to make away with his rival so soon as that
should take place; and from what we know of Coriolanus’ character, and
Tullus’ comprehension of it<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
and general astuteness in management, we feel sure that the scheme was
bound to succeed, if Coriolanus persisted in his old ways. Even as
things have turned out, Marcius has all the odds in his favour. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</span>
triumphal entry into Antium is a repetition of his triumphal entry
into Rome. When, according to the stage direction, “Drums and trumpets
sound, with great shouts of the People,” the malcontents turn to
Aufidius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

constrained by his prowess, is the same sort of obstacle to these
factionaries as it formerly was to the tribunes; and with that, and
his great services as well, he commands the situation. He needs only a
minimum of skill and moderation to carry all before him. So the problem
of his antagonists is the same in both cases: namely, to neutralise
these advantages by rousing his passion, and provoking him to show his
pride, his recklessness, his uncompromising rigour. In both cases he
falls into the trap, and converts the popular goodwill to hatred by
defiantly harping on the injuries he has inflicted on his admirers.
He is the unregenerate “superman” to the last. The suppression of his
victorious surname, the taunts of “traitor” and “boy,” drive him mad.
He lets himself be transported to a bravado that must shake from sleep
all the latent hostility of the Volscians.</p>

<p class="no-indent">The patient fools, whose children he had slain,
are not patient now, and no longer tear their throats in acclaiming his
glory. Their cries, “Tear him to pieces,” “He killed my son,” and the
like, give the conspirators the cue, and Aufidius is presently standing
on his body.</p>

<p>It is not, then, as a martyr to retrieved patriotism that Coriolanus
perishes, but as the victim of his own passion. In truth, the victory
he won over himself under the influence of his mother, though real, is
very incomplete. His piety to the hearth saves him from the superlative
infamy of destroying his country, which is something, and even a good
deal; but it is not everything; and beyond that it has no result,
public or personal. On the contrary, Coriolanus’ isolated and but
partly justified act of clemency receives its comment from the motives
that induced it, the troth-breach that accompanied it, and the rage
in which he passed away. If, like his son with the butterfly, he did
grasp honour at the close, it was disfigured by his rude handling.
But at least he never belies his own great though mixed nature, and
it is fitting that his death, needless but heroic, should have its
cause in his nature and be such as his nature would select. Indeed,
it is both his nemesis and his guerdon. For he would not be a Roman,
he could not be a Volsce; what part could he have played in the years
to come? Perhaps Shakespeare read in Philemon Holland’s rendering the
alternative account that Livy gives of the final scene.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</span></p>

<p class="blockquot">I find in Fabius, a most ancient writer, that
he lived untill he was an old man: who repeateth this of him:
that oftentimes in his latter daies he used to utter this speech:
<i>A heavie case and most wretched, for an aged man to live</i>
<i>banisht</i>.</p>

<p class="no-indent">At all events some such feeling as his regrets
in this variant tradition suggest, makes us prefer the version that
Plutarch followed and that Shakespeare adapted. Coriolanus deserves to
be spared the woes that the future has in store. As it is, he falls
in the fulness of his power, inspired by great memories to greater
audacity, and, no doubt, elated at the thought of challenging and
outbraving death, when death is sure to win.</p>

<p class="neg-indent">THE VERBAL RELATIONS OF THE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF
PLUTARCH ILLUSTRATED BY MEANS OF VOLUMNIA’S SPEECH</p>

<p>This passage, though it does not show the successive modifications of
the text quite so fully and strikingly as some others, is the most
interesting in so far as it is the longest in which Shakespeare closely
follows the lead of the original.</p>

<p>The Latin version of the Renaissance is placed first, both because in
definite form it is chronologically the earliest, and because for the
reasons already given it cannot be held to have had much influence on
Amyot, North and Shakespeare.</p>

<p>It is of course impossible to reconstruct the Greek text that Amyot
put together for himself. I have taken that of the edition of 1599,
published half a dozen years after his death, as a fair approximation.
The chief variations from the Latin are given in spaced type.</p>

<p>In the extract from Amyot the chief variations from the Greek are
printed in Italics; the few phrases or words in which the influence of
the Latin may be suspected are underlined.</p>

<p>In the extract from North the chief variations from the French are
printed in Italics.</p>

<p class="space-below2">In the extract from Shakespeare, it is, as we
might expect, more convenient to reverse the process and italicise what
he has taken over.

praecibus. Uxorem enim ac liberos aut patria aut te orbari necesse est.
Ego vero, dum haec viventi mihi bellum dijudicet, haud morabor, teque
nisi positis inimicitiis ad pacem atque concordiam conciliavero; ita ut
utrique<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
potius beneficum quam alteri perniciosum te reddas. Hoc tibi persuade
sicque conformatus et paratus accede, ut non ante hostiles patriae
manus conferas quam caesam calcaveris parentem. Nec enim ea mihi
expectanda dies est qua filium aut in triumpho tractum a civibus aut de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</span>
patria triumphantem aspiciam. Quod si pro conservanda patria profligari
a te Volscos exorarem, grave fili iniquumque tibi fateor imminere
consilium; namque necque cives perdere bonum est, necque tuos commissos
fidei perdere justum. Nunc malorum finem imploramus simulque populis
utrisque salutem. Quae res maximam Volscis gloriam comparabit: quod
cum ingentia nobis bona et victores quidem tribuerint, non minus
jocundam ipsi pacem et amicitiam sint consecuturi: quae si effecta
fuerint, tu tantorum profecto dux eris et causa bonorum: sin ea infecta
permanserint, utrique noxam in te solum crimenque rejicient. Cumque
incertus belli sit eventus, hoc certi secum affert: ut siquidem vincas
immanissimus patriae vastator appellandus sis, sin victus succumbas,
ob tuam videberis iracundiam benefactoribus et amicis ingentium origo
malorum extitisse.” Haec dum oraret Volumnia, nullum respondens
verbum Martius intentis excipiebat auribus. Ut vero desierat, cum is
diuturnum teneret silentium, rursus Volumnia; “Quid siles,” inquit.
“Nate, num irae receptarumque injuriarum memoriae omnia concedere
satius arbitraris an depraecanti talia matri largiri pulcherrimum
munificentiae genus non est? Magnine interesse viri putas acceptorum
meminisse malorum? Suscepta autem a parentibus beneficia eorum cultui
ac venerationi reddere num excelso potius ac bono dignissimum viro
munus censes? Caeterum gratiam habere tuerique magisquam tu debuit
nemo, cum tamen per acerbissimam adeo ingratitudinem eas. Et cum
permagnas jam patriae paenas exegeris acceperisque, nullas adhuc matri
grates retulisti. Erat vero aequissimum atque sanctissimum ut abs te
vel nulla ingruenti necessitate tam honesta tamque justa postulans
impetrarem. Quid cum in meam te verbis sententiam deflectere nequeam,
extremae jam parco spei?” Haec affata cum uxore simul ac liberis
pedibus advoluta procumbit. Tum conclamans Martius, “Qualia mihi” ait
“factitasti mater”; et jacentem sustulit: et pressa dextera inquit;
“Vicisti patriae quidem prosperam, nimis atque nimis perniciosam
autem<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
mihi victoriam. Abs te tantum superatus abscedam.”</p>

<p><i>Elle prit sa belle fille</i> et ses enfans quand et<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
elle, et avec toutes les autres Dames Romaines s’en alla droit au camp
des Volsques, lesquelz eurent eulx-mesmes une compassion meslee de
reverence quand ils la veirent <i>de maniere qu’il n’y eut personne
d’eulx qui luy ozast rien dire</i>. Or estoit lors Martius assis en son
tribunal, <i>avec les marques de souverain Capitaine</i>,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>
et <i>de tout loing</i> qu’il apperceut venir des femmes, s’esmerveilla
que ce pouvoit estre; mais peu apres recognoissant sa femme, qui
marchoit la premiere, il voulut <i>du commencement</i> perseverer en
son obstinee et inflexible <i>rigueur</i>; mais à la fin, vaincu de
l’affection naturelle, estant tout esmeu de les voir, il <i>ne peut</i>
avoir le <i>coeur si dur</i> que de les attendre en son siege,
ains<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
en descendant plus viste que le pas, leur alla au devant, et baisa sa mere
la premiere, et la teint assez longuement embrassee, puis sa femme et
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_636">[Pg 636]</span>
ses petits enfants, ne se pouvant plus tenir que les <i>chauldes</i>
larmes ne luy vinssent <i>aux yeux</i>, ny se garder de leur faire
caresses, ains se laissant aller à l’affection <i>du sang</i> ne
plus ne moins qu’à <i>la force</i> d’un impetueux torrent. Mais
apres qu’il leur eut assez faict <i>d’aimable recueil</i>, et qu’il
apperceut que sa mere Volumnia vouloit commencer a luy parler, il
appella les principaux du conseil des Volsques pour <i>ouyr ce qu’elle
proposeroit</i>, puis elle parla en ceste maniere: “Tu peux assez
cognoistre de toy mesme, mon filz, encore que nous ne t’en dissions
rien, à voir noz accoustremens, et l’estat auquel sont noz pauvres
corps, quelle a esté nostre vie en la maison depuis tu en es dehors;
mais considere encore maintenant combien plus <i>mal heureuses</i>
et plus infortunees nous sommes icy venues que toutes les femmes du
monde, attendu que ce qui est à toutes les autres le plus doulx a voir,
la fortune nous l’a rendu le plus effroyable, faisant voir à moy mon
filz, et à celle-ci, son mary, assiegeant les murailles de son propre
païs; tellement que ce qui est à toutes autres le <i>souverain</i>
renconfort en leurs adversitez, de <i>prier</i> et invoquer les Dieux
à leur secours, c’est ce qui nous met en plus grande perplexité,
pource que nous ne leur sçaurions demander en noz prieres victoire a
nostre païs et preservation de ta vie tout ensemble, ains toutes les
plus griefves maledictions que sçauroit imaginer contre nous un ennemy
sont <i>necessairement</i> encloses en noz oraisons, pource qu’il
est force à ta femme et à tes enfans qu’ilz soyent privez de l’un de
deux, ou de toy, ou de leurs païs: car quant a moy, je ne suis pas
deliberee d’attendre que la fortune, moy vivante, decide <i>l’issue
de ceste guerre</i>: car si je ne te puis persuader que tu vueilles
plus tost bien faire à toutes les deux parties, que d’en <i>ruiner</i>
et destruire l’une, en preferant amitie et concorde aux miseres et
calamitez de la guerre, je veux bien que tu saches et le tienes pour
asseuré que tu n’iras jamais assaillir ny combattre ton païs que
premierement tu ne passes par dessus le corps de celle qui t’a mis
en ce monde, et ne doy point differer jusques à voir le jour, ou que
mon filz <i>prisonnier</i> soit mené en triumphe par ses citoyens,
ou que luy mesme triumphe de son païs. Or si ainsi estoit que je te
requisse de sauver ton païs en destruisant les Volsques, ce te serait
certainement une deliberation trop mal-aisee à resoudre; car comme il
n’est point licite de ruiner son païs, aussi n’est-il point juste de
trahir ceulx qui se sont fiez en toy. Mais ce que je te demande est une
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</span>
delivrance de maulx, laquelle est egalement <i>profitable</i> et
salutaire à l’un et à l’autre peuple, mais plus honorable aux Volsques,
pource qu’il semblera qu’ayans la victoire en main, ils nous auront de
grace donné deux souverains biens, la paix et l’amitié, encore qu’ilz
n’en prennent pas moins pour eulx, duquel tu seras principal autheur,
s’il se fait; et, s’il ne se fait, tu en auras seul le <i>reproche
et le blasme</i><a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
total envers l’une et l’autre des parties: ainsi <i>estant l’issue de
la guerre</i> incertaine,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>
cela neantmoins est bien tout certain que, si tu en demoures
vaincueur, il t’en restera <i>ce profit</i>, que tu en seras estimé
la <i>peste</i> et la ruine de ton païs: et si tu es vaincu, on dira
que pour un <i>appetit de venger tes propres injures</i> tu auras esté
cause de tres griefves calamitez à ceulx qui t’avoient humainement et
amiablement recueilly.” Martius escouta ces paroles de Volumnia sa
mere sans l’interrompre, et apres qu’elle eut acheve de dire demoura
longtemps tout <i>picqué</i> sans luy respondre. Parquoy elle reprit
la parole et recommencea à luy dire: “Que ne me respons-tu, mon filz?
Estimes-tu qu’il soit licite de conceder tout à son ire et à son
appetit de vengeance, et non honeste de condescendre et <i>incliner</i>
aux prieres de sa mere en si grandes choses? Et <i>cuides-tu</i> qu’il
soit convenable a un grand personnage, se souvenir des torts qu’on luy
a faits et <i>des injures passees</i>, et que ce ne soit point acte
d’homme de bien et de grand cueur, <i>recognoistre</i> les bienfaicts
que reçoyvent les enfans de leurs peres et meres, en leur portant
honneur et reverence? Si<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
n’y a il homme en ce monde qui deust mieux observer tous les poincts de
gratitude que toy, veu que tu poursuis si asprement une ingratitude:
et si<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
y a davantage, que tu as ja fait payer a ton païs de grandes
amendes pour les torts que l’on t’y a faits, et n’as encore fait aucune
recognoissance a ta mere; pourtant seroit-il plus honeste que sans
autre contrainte j’<i>impetrasse</i><a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
de toy une requeste si juste et si raisonnable. Mais puis que <i>par
raison</i> je ne le te puis persuader, à quel besoing espargne-je plus,
et <i>differe-je</i> la derniere esperance.” En disant ces paroles
elle se jetta elle mesme, avec sa femme et ses enfans, a ses pieds. Ce
que Martius <i>ne pouvant supporter</i>, la releva tout aussi tost en
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</span>
s’escriant: “O mere, que m’as tu faict?” et un luy serrant
estroittement la main droite: “Ha,” dit il, “Mere, tu as vaincu une
victoire heureuse pour ton païs mais bien <i>malheureuse</i> et
mortelle pour ton filz, car je m’en revois<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
vaincu par toy seule.”</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><span class="smcap">North’s Version.</span></p>

<p>She tooke her daughter in lawe, and Martius children with her, and
being accompanied with all the other Romaine ladies, they went <i>in
troupe</i> together unto the Volsces camp: whome when they sawe, they
of them selves did both pitie and reverence her, and there was not a
man amonge them that once durst say a worde unto her. Nowe was Martius
set then in his chayer of state, with all the honours of a generall,
and when he had spied the women coming a farre of, he marveled what
the matter ment: but afterwardes knowing his wife which came formest,
he determined at the first to persist in his obstinate and inflexible
rancker. But overcomen in the ende with naturall affection, and being
altogether altered to see them; his harte <i>would not serve him</i> to
tarie their comming to his chayer, but comming down in hast, he went to
meete them, and first he kissed his mother, and imbraced her a pretie
while, then his wife and litle children. And <i>Nature so wrought with
him</i>, that the<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
teares fell from his eyes, and he coulde not keepe him selfe from
making much of them, but yeelded to the affection of his bloode as
if he had bene <i>violently</i> caried with the furie of a most
swift running streame. After he had thus lovingly received them, and
perceiving that his mother Volumnia would beginne to speake to him,
he called the chiefest of the counsell of the Volsces to heare what
she would say. Then she spake in this sorte: “If we held our peace,
(my sonne) and <i>determined not to speake</i>, the state of our poor
bodies, and <i>present</i> sight of our rayment, would easely bewray to
thee what life we have led at home, since thy exile and abode abroad.
But thinke nowe with thy selfe, how much more unfortunatly,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
then all the women livinge we are come hether, considering that the sight
which should be most pleasaunt to all other to beholde, <i>spitefull</i>
fortune hath made most fearefull to us: making my selfe to see my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</span>
sonne, and my daughter here, her husband, besieging the walles of his
native countrie. So as that which is thonly comforte to all other in
their adversitie and <i>miserie</i>, to pray unto the goddes and to
call to them for aide; is the <i>onely</i> thinge which <i>plongeth</i>
us into most deepe perplexitie. For we can not (alas) together pray,
both for victorie, for our countrie, and for safetie of thy life
also: but a <i>worlde</i> of grievous curses, <i>yea more then any
mortall</i> enemie can heape uppon us, are forcibly wrapt up in our
prayers. For the <i>bitter soppe of most hard choyce</i> is offered thy
wife and children, to forgoe the one of the two: either to lose the
<i>persone</i> of thy selfe, or the <i>nurse</i> of<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
their native contrie. For my selfe (my sonne) I am determined not to tarie,
till fortune in my life time do make an ende of this warre. For if I cannot
persuade thee, rather to doe good unto both parties than to overthrowe
and destroye the one, preferring love and <i>nature</i> before the
<i>malice</i> and calamitie of warres: <i>thou shalt</i> see, my sonne,
and trust unto it,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
thou shalt no soner marche forward to assault thy countrie, but thy
foote shall treade upon thy mothers <i>wombe</i>, that brought thee
first into this world. And I maye not deferre to see the daye, either
that my sonne be led prisoner in triumphe by his <i>naturall</i>
country men, or that he him selfe doe triumphe <i>of them</i>, and
of his <i>naturall</i> countrie. For if it were so, that my request
tended to save thy countrie, in destroying the Volsces: <i>I must
confesse</i>, thou wouldest hardly and <i>doubtfully</i> resolve
on that. For as to destroye thy naturall countrie it is altogether
<i>unmete</i> and unlawfull; so were it not just, and <i>lesse
honorable</i>, to betraye those that put their trust in thee. But my
only demaunde consisteth to make a <i>gayle</i><a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
deliverie of all evills, which delivereth equall benefit and safety
both to the one and the other, but most honorable for the Volsces. For
it shall appeare, that having victorie in their hands, they have of
speciall favour graunted us singular graces; peace, and amitie, albeit
them selves have no lesse parte of both, then we. Of which <i>good</i>,
if so it came to passe, thy selfe is thonly authour, <i>and so hast
thou thonly honour</i>. But if it faile, <i>and fall out contrarie</i>:
thy selfe alone <i>deservedly</i> shall carie the <i>shameful</i>
reproche and burden of either partie. So, though the ende of warre be
uncertaine, yet this notwithstanding is most certaine: that if it be thy
chaunce to conquer, this benefit shalt thou <i>reape</i> of <i>thy goodly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</span>
conquest</i>, to be chronicled the plague and destroyer of thy
countrie. And if fortune also overthrowe thee, then the worlde will
saye, that through desire to revenge thy private injuries, thou hast
<i>for ever</i> undone thy good friendes, who dyd most lovingly and
curteously receyve thee.” Martius gave good eare unto his mothers
wordes, without interrupting <i>her speache at all</i>: and after she
had sayed <i>what she would</i>, he held his peace a prety while,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
and annswered not a worde. Hereupon she beganne again to speake unto
him, and sayed: “My sonne, why doest thou not aunswer me? Doest thou
think it good altogether to geve place unto thy choller and desire of
revenge, and thinkest thou it not honestie for thee to graunt<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
thy mothers request in so weighty a cause? doest thou take it honorable
for a noble man, to remember the wrongs and injuries done him: and
doest not in like case thinke it an honest noble man’s parte, to be
thankefull for the goodnes that parents doe shewe to their children,
acknowledging the duety and reverence <i>they ought to beare unto
them</i>?<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
No man living is more bounde to shewe him selfe thankefull
in all partes and respects then thy selfe: who so unnaturally sheweth
all ingratitude.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
Moreover (my sonne) thou hast sorely taken of thy countrie, exacting
grievous payments apon them, in revenge of the injuries offered thee:
besides, thou hast not hitherto shewed thy poore mother any
curtesie.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
And therefore it is <i>not only</i> honest, <i>but due unto me</i>,
that without compulsion I should obtaine my so just and reasonable
request of thee. But since by reason I cannot persuade thee to it, to
what purpose do I deferre<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
my last hope?” And with these wordes her selfe, his wife and children
fell downe upon their knees before him. Martius seeing that could
refraine no longer but <i>went straight</i> and lifte her up, crying
out: “Oh mother, what have you done to me?” And holding her hard by the
right hand, “Oh mother,” sayed he, “You have wonne a happy victorie for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</span>
your countrie, but mortall and unhappy for your sonne: for I
see<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
myself vanquished by you alone.”</p>

<p class="f120 space-above2"><span class="smcap">Shakespeare’s Version.</span></p>

<p>The narrative which ushers in the speech is of course left to the
actors. It is interesting, however, to observe that Shakespeare varies
from his authorities in making Coriolanus embrace not his mother but
his wife in the first instance. He inserts too the conversation, that,
at first merely personal, leads up to the grand question. Then Volumnia
proceeds with her speech. It is impossible to note all the minute
changes that Shakespeare makes. The Italics in the following reprint
represent most generously what he has borrowed, for even in the clauses
and phrases indicated as loans there is abundant evidence of his own
irrepressible dramatic and poetic originality.</p>

<p class="f120">SHAKESPEARE’S ALLEGED INDEBTEDNESS TO APPIAN IN <i>JULIUS CAESAR</i></p>

<p>Plutarch gives little more than the situation and the <i>motif</i> for
Antony’s oration. He has two accounts of the incident.</p>

<div class="blockquot space-below2">
<p>(<i>a</i>) When Caesars body was brought into the Market Place,
Antonius making his funeral oration in praise of the dead according
to the ancient custom of Rome, and perceiving that his wordes moved
the common people to compassion; he framed his eloquence to make their
harts yerne the more, and taking Caesars gowne all bloudy in his hand,
he layed it open to the sight of them all, shewing what a number of
cuts and holes it had upon it. Therewithall the people fell presently
into such a rage and mutinie, that there was no more order kept amongs
the common people.</p>
<p class="author">(<i>Marcus Brutus.</i>)</p>

<p class="space-above1">(<i>b</i>) When Caesars body was brought to
the place where it should be buried, he made a funeral oration in
commendacion of Caesar, according to the auncient custom of praising
noble men at their funerals. When he saw that the people were very
glad and desirous to heare Caesar spoken of, and his praises uttered:
he mingled his oration with lamentable wordes, and by amplifying of
matters did greatly move their harts and affections unto pitie and
compassion. In fine to conclude his oration, he unfolded before the
whole assembly the bloudy garments of the dead, thrust through in many
places with their swords, and called the malefactors, cruell and cursed
murtherers. With these words he put the people into ... a fury.</p>
<p class="author">(<i>Marcus Antonius.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Shakespeare certainly did not get
much of the stuff for Antony’s speech from these notices.</p>

<p>Appian, on the other hand, gives a much fuller report, which was quite
accessible to ordinary readers, for Appian had been published in 1578
by Henrie Bynniman.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</span>
The English version of the most important passages runs thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Antony marking how they were affected, did not let it slippe, but
toke upon him to make Caesars funeral sermon, as Consul, of a Consul,
friend of a friend, and kinsman, of a kinsman (for Antony was partly
his kinsman) and to use craft againe. And thus he said: “I do not
thinke it meete (O citizens) that the buriall praise of suche a man,
should rather be done by me, than by the whole country. For what you
have altogither for the loue of hys vertue giuen him by decree, aswell
the Senate as the people, I thinke your voice, and not Antonies, oughte
to expresse it.”</p>

<p>This he uttered with sad and heauy cheare, and wyth a framed
voice, declared euerything, chiefly upon the decree, whereby he was
made a God, holy and inuiolate, father of the country, benefactor
and gouernor, and suche a one, as neuer in al things they entituled
other man to the like. At euery of these words Antonie directed his
countenance and hands to Caesars body, and with vehemencie of words
opened the fact. At euery title he gaue an addition, with briefe
speach, mixte with pitie and indignation. And when the decree named him
father of the country, then he saide: “This is the testimony of our
duety.”</p>

<p>And at these wordes, <i>holy</i>, <i>inuiolate</i> and
<i>untouched</i>, and <i>the refuge of all other</i>, he said: “None
other made refuge of hym. But he, this holy and untouched, is kylled,
not takyng honoure by violences whiche he neuer desired, and then be we
verye thrall that bestowe them on the unworthy, neuer suing for them.
But you doe purge your selves (O Citizens) of this unkindnesse, in that
you nowe do use suche honoure towarde hym being dead.”</p>

<p>Then rehearsing the othe, that all shoulde keepe Caesar and Caesars
body, and if any one wente about to betraye hym, that they were
accursed that would not defende him: at this he extolled hys voice, and
helde up his handes to the Capitoll, saying:</p>

<p>“O Jupiter, Countries defendour, and you other Gods, I am ready to
reuenge, as I sware and made execration, and when it seemes good to my
companions to allowe the decrees, I desire them to aide me.”</p>

<p>At these plaine speeches spoken agaynst the Senate, an uproare being
made, Antony waxed colde, and recanted hys wordes. “It seemeth, (O
Citizens),” saide hee, “that the things done haue not bin the worke
of men but of Gods, and that we ought to haue more consideration of
the present, than of the past, bycause the thyngs to come, maye bring
us to greater danger than these we haue, if we shall returne to oure
olde [dissentions], and waste the reste of the noble men that be in
the Cittie. Therefore let us send thys holy one to the number of the
blessed, and sing to him his due hymne and mourning verse.”</p>

<p>When he had saide thus, he pulled up his gowne lyke a man beside
hymselfe, and gyrded it, that he might the better stirre his handes:
he stoode ouer the Litter, as from a Tabernacle, looking into it and
opening it, and firste sang his Himne, as to a God in heauen. And to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</span>
confirme he was a God, he held up his hands, and with a swift voice he
rehearsed the warres, the fights, the victories, the nations that he
had subdued to his countrey, and the great booties that he had sent,
making euery one to be a maruell. Then with a continuall crie,</p>

<p class="blockquot">“This is the only unconquered of all that euer
came to hands with hym. Thou (quoth he) alone diddest reuenge thy
countrey being iniured, 300 years, and those fierce nations that only
inuaded Rome, and only burned it, thou broughtest them on their knees.”</p>

<p>And when he had made these and many other inuocations, he tourned
hys voice from triumphe to mourning matter, and began to lament and
mone him as a friend that had bin uniustly used, and did desire that
he might giue hys soule for Caesars. Then falling into moste vehement
affections, uncouered Caesars body, holding up his vesture with a
speare, cut with the woundes, and redde with the bloude of the chiefe
Ruler, by the which the people lyke a Quire, did sing lamentation
unto him, and with this passion were againe repleate with ire. And
after these speeches, other lamentations wyth voice after the Country
custome, were sung of the Quires, and they rehearsed again his acts and
his hap.</p>

<p>Then made he Caesar hymselfe to speake as it were in a lamentable
sort, to howe many of his enimies he hadde done good by name, and
of the killers themselves to say as in an admiration, “Did I saue
them that haue killed me?” This the people could not abide, calling
to remembraunce, that all the kyllers (only Decimus except) were of
Pompey’s faction, and subdued by hym, to whom, in stead of punishment,
he had giuen promotion of offices, gouernments of prouinces and armies,
and thought Decimus worthy to be made his heyre and son by adoption,
and yet conspired his death.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Now, this is not very like the oration in the
play. It may be analysed and summarised as follows:</p>

<p>Antony begins by praising the deceased as a consul a consul, a friend a
friend, a kinsman a kinsman. He recites the public honours awarded to
Caesar as a better testimony than his private opinion, and accompanies
the enumeration with provocative comment. He touches on Caesar’s
sacrosanct character and the unmerited honours bestowed on those who
slew him, but acquits the citizens of unkindness on the ground of their
presence at the funeral. He avows his own readiness for revenge, and
thus censures the policy of the Senate, but admits that that policy may
be for the public interest. He intones a hymn in honour of the deified
Caesar; reviews his wars, battles, victories, the provinces annexed
and the spoils transmitted to Rome, and glances at the subjugation of
the Gauls as the payment of an ancient score. He uncovers the body of
Caesar and displays the pierced and blood-stained garment to the wrath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</span>
of the populace. He puts words in the mouth of the dead, and makes him
cite the names of those whom he had benefited and preserved that they
should destroy him. And the people brook no more.</p>

<p>Thus Appian’s Antony differs from Shakespeare’s Antony in his
attitude to his audience, in the arrangement of his material, and to
a considerable extent in the material itself. Nevertheless, in some
of the details the speeches correspond. It is quite possible that
Shakespeare, while retaining Plutarch’s general scheme, may have
filled it in with suggestions from Appian. The evidence is not very
convincing, but the conjecture is greatly strengthened by the apparent
loans from the same quarter in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, which would
show that he was acquainted with the English translation.

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX D</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120">SHAKESPEARE’S LOANS FROM APPIAN IN<br />
<i>ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA</i></p>

<p>I do not think there can be any serious doubt about Shakespeare’s
having consulted the 1578 translation of the <i>Bella Civilia</i> for
this play, at any rate for the parts dealing with Sextus Pompeius.
The most important passage is the one (<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="smcap">iii.</span>
v. 19) which records Antony’s indignation at Pompey’s death. Now of
that death there is no mention at all in the <i>Marcus Antonius</i>
of Plutarch; and even in the <i>Octavius Caesar Augustus</i> by Simon
Goulard, which was included in the 1583 edition of Amyot and in the
1603 edition of North, it is expressly attributed to Antony. Here is
Goulard’s statement:<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p class="blockquot">Whilst Antonius made war with the Parthians, or
rather infortunately they made war with him to his great confusion, his
lieutenant Titius found the means to lay hands upon Sextus Pompeius;
that was fled into the ile of Samos, and then forty years old: whom he
put to death by Antonius’ commandment.</p>

<p class="no-indent">Appian at least leaves it an open question
whether Antony was responsible or not, and thus gives his apologist an
opportunity:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Titius commaunded hys (<i>i.e.</i> Pompey’s) army to sweare to
Antony, and put hym to death at Mileto, when he hadde lyved to the age
of fortye yeares, eyther for that he remembered late displeasure and
forgot olde good turnes, or for that he had such commaundemente of Antony.</p>

<p><i>There bee that saye that Plancus, and not Antony did commaunde
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</span>
hym to dye, whyche beeyng president of Syria had Antonyes signet, and
in greate causes wrote letters in hys name.</i> Some thynke it was
done wyth Antonyes knowledge, he fearyng the name of Pompey, or for
Cleopatra, who fauoured Pompey the Great.</p>

<p><i>Some thynke that Plancus dyd it of hymselfe</i> for these causes,
and also that Pompey shoulde gyve no cause of dissention between Caesar
and Antony, or for that Cleopatra would turn hyr favour to Pompey.</p>

<p class="author space-below2">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> cxiv.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I do not think indeed that there is any indication
that Shakespeare had read, or at all events been in any way impressed
by, Goulard’s <i>Augustus</i>: no wonder, for compared with the genuine
<i>Lives</i>, it is a dull performance. The only other passages with
which a connection might be traced, do no more than give hints that
are better given in Appian. Thus Sextus Pompeius’ vein of chivalry,
of which there is hardly a suggestion in Plutarch’s brief notices,
is illustrated in Goulard by his behaviour to the fugitives from the
proscription.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Pompeius had sent certain ships to keep upon the
coast of Italy, and pinnaces everywhere, to the end to receive all
them that fled on that side; giving them double recompence that saved
a proscript, and honourable offices to men that had been consuls and
escaped, comforting and entertaining the others with a most singular
courtesy.</p>

<p class="no-indent">But Appian says all this too in greater detail,
and adds the significant touch:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>So was he moste profitable to hys afflicted Countrey, and
wanne greate glory to hymselfe, <i>not inferioure to that he
hadde of hys father</i>.</p>

<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xxxvi.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Note particularly this reference to his father’s
reputation, for which there is no parallel in Plutarch or Goulard; and
compare</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">Our slippery people</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Upon his son.</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">(<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> ii. 192.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Rich in his father’s honour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">(<i>Ib.</i> <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 50.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Again, Goulard, talking of the last struggle, says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">After certain encounters, where Pompey ever had
the better, insomuch as Lepidus was suspected to lean on that side,
Caesar resolved to commit all to the hazard of a latter battle.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</span>
The insinuation in regard to Lepidus might be taken as the foundation
for Shakespeare’s statement, which has no sanction in Plutarch, that
Caesar</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey.</div>
    <div class="verse indent26">(<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">III.</span> v. 10.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But it seems a closer echo of a remark of Appian’s
about some transactions shortly after Philippi:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lepidus was accused to favour Pompey’s part.</div>
    <div class="verse indent31">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> iii.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">There are, moreover, several touches in
Shakespeare’s sketch, that he could no more get from Goulard than
from Plutarch, but that are to be found in Appian. Thus there is
Pompey’s association with the party of the “good Brutus” and the
enthusiasm he expresses for “beauteous freedom” (<i>A. and C.</i>
<span class="smcap">ii.</span> vi. 13 and 17). Compare passages
like the following in Appian:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sextus Pompey, the seconde son of Pompey the Great being
lefte of that faction, was sette up of Brutus friends.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> i.)</p>

<p>Pompey’s friends hearing of this, did marvellously rejoyce,
crying now to be time to restore their Countrey’s libertie.</p>
<p class="author space-below1">(<span class="allsmcap">III.</span> lxxxii.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Thus, too, Shakespeare refers to Pompey’s
command of “the empire of the sea” (<i>A. and C.</i>
<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 191), which, if Plutarch were his
authority, would be an unjustifiable exaggeration. Yet it exactly
corresponds to the facts of the case as Appian repeatedly states them,
and perhaps one of Binniman’s expressions suggested the very phrase.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Pompey <i>being Lorde of the Sea</i> ... caused famine
in the cittie all victuall beyng kepte away.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> xv.)</p>

beeing in Sicelie, nor from the Weast of Corsica and Sardinia, where
Pompeis ships also lay: nor from Africa, where the navies of the other
conspiratours kepte their stations. Being in this distresse, they
(<i>i.e.</i> the people) alleaged that the discorde of the rulers was
the cause, and therefore required that peace might be made with Pompey,
unto the whiche when Caesar woulde not agree, Antonie thought warre was
needefull for necessitie.</p>
<p class="author">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> lxvii.)</p>

<p class="no-indent">Then there are the frequent references of
Antony (<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">i.</span> ii. 192,
<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iii. 148), of the messenger
(<span class="allsmcap">i.</span> iv. 38, <span class="allsmcap">i.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</span>
iv. 52), of Pompey himself (<span class="smcap">ii.</span> i. 9),
to Pompey’s popularity and the rush of recruits to his standard.
Neither Goulard nor Plutarch makes mention of these points, but Appian
does often, and most emphatically in the following passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Out of Italy all things were not quiet, for Pompey by resorte of
condemned Citizens, and auntient possessioners was greatly increased,
both in mighte, and estimation: for they that feared their life, or
were spoyled of their goodes, or lyked not the present state, fledde
all to hym. And this disagreemente of Lucius augmented his credite:
beside a repayre of yong men, desirous of gayne and seruice, not caring
under whome they went, because they were all Romanes, sought unto
him. And among other, hys cause seemed most just. He was waxed rich
by booties of the Sea, and he hadde good store of Shyppes, with their
furniture.... Wherefore me thynke, that if he had then inuaded Italy,
he might easily have gotte it, which being afflicted with famine and
discord loked for him. But Pompey of ignorance had rather defend his
owne, than inuade others, till so he was ouercome also.</p>
<p class="author space-below1">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> xxv.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It should be noted too that Menas, to whom Appian
always gives his full formal name of Menodorus, not only as in Plutarch
proposes to make away with the Triumvirs after the compact, but as in
the play (<span class="smcap">ii</span>, vi. 84 and 109) and not as in
Plutarch, disapproves the cessation of hostilities.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>All other persuaded Pompey earnestly to peace, only
Menodorus wrote from Sardinia that he should make open
<i>warre, or dryve off</i>,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
whyles the dearth continued, <i>that he might make peace with</i> the
better conditions.</p>
<p class="author space-below1">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> lxxi.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I have not noticed any other points of
importance in which there is an apparent connection between the
drama and the <i>Roman History</i>: unless indeed Antony’s passing
compunction for Fulvia’s death may be so regarded.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Newes came that Antonies wyfe was dead, who coulde not bear his
unkyndenesse, leavyng her sicke, &amp; not bidding hyr farewell. Hir
death was thought very commodius for them both. For Fulvia was an
unquiet woman, &amp; for ielousie of Cleopatra, raysed suche a mortall
warre. Yet the matter vexed Antony bicause he was compted the occasion
of her death.</p>
<p class="author space-below1">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> lix.)</p>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Here, however, the motive of Antony’s regret
differs from that which Shakespeare attributes to him; and on the whole
the references to Fulvia in the play deviate even more from Appian’s
account than from Plutarch’s. So far as I am in a position to judge,
Shakespeare derived all his other historical data, as well as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</span>
general scheme into which he fitted these trifling loans, from
Plutarch’s <i>Life</i>, and can be considered a debtor to Appian only
in the points that are illustrated in my previous extracts.</p>

<p>But there are two qualifications I should like to make to this
statement.</p>

<p>In the first place, I have not seen the 1578 version of Appian, the
passages I have quoted being merely transcripts made by my direction. I
have had only the original text to work upon, and it is possible that
the Tudor Translation might offer verbal coincidences that of course
would not suggest themselves to me.</p>

<p>In the second place, the book is not merely a translation of Appian.
The descriptive title runs: “An auncient historie and exquisite
chronicle of the Romanes warres, both civile and foren ... with a
continuation ... from the death of Sextus Pompeius to the overthrow of
Antonie and Cleopatra.”</p>

<p>Appian’s History of the Civil Wars, as now extant, concludes at the
death of Sextus Pompeius. The Tudor translator’s continuation till
the deaths of Antony and Cleopatra may be responsible for some of the
later deviations from Plutarch, which I have described as independent
modifications of Shakespeare’s. The matter is worth looking into.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from my collation I draw two conclusions, the first
definitive, the second provisional:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(1) That Shakespeare laid Appian under contribution to fill
in the details of his picture.</p>

<p>(2) That he borrowed from him, that is, from his English
translator, only for the episode of Sextus Pompeius.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">APPENDIX E</h2>
</div>

<p class="f120 space-below1">CLEOPATRA’S <i>ONE WORD</i></p>

<p>Professor Th. Zielinski of St. Petersburg suggests a peculiar
interpretation of this passage in his <i>Marginalien</i>
(<i>Philologus</i>, N.F., Band xviii. 1905). He starts from the
assertion that Shakespeare had in his mind Ovid’s <i>Epistle from
Dido</i> (<i>Heroid.</i> vii.) when he composed the parting scene
between Antony and Cleopatra. This statement is neither self-evident
nor initially probable. Shakespeare was no doubt acquainted with
portions of Ovid both in the original and in translation, but there is
not much indication that his knowledge extended to the <i>Heroides</i>.
Mr. Churton Collins, indeed, in his plea for Shakespeare’s familiarity
with Latin, calls attention to the well-known pair of quotations
from these poems, the one in <i>3 Henry VI.</i>, the other in the
<i>Taming of the Shrew</i>. But though Mr. Collins makes good his
general contention, he hardly strengthens it with these examples: for
Shakespeare’s share in both plays is so uncertain that no definite
inference can be drawn from them. Apart from these more than doubtful
instances, there seems to be no reference in Shakespeare to the
<i>Heroides</i>, either in the Latin of Ovid or in the English of
Turberville; and it would be strange to find one cropping up here.</p>

<p>But Professor Zielinski gives his arguments, and one of them is
certainly plausible. He quotes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What says the married woman? You may go:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Would she had never given you leave to come;</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">(<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">I.</span> iii. 20.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">and compares</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sed iubet ire deus.” Vellem vetuisset adire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent24">(<i>Her.</i> <span class="allsmcap">VII.</span> 37.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</span>
There is a coincidence, but it is not very close, and scarcely implies
imitation. Moreover, it becomes even less striking in the English
version; which, after all, Shakespeare is more likely to have known, if
he knew the poem at all:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But God doth force thee flee; would God had kept away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such guilefull guests, and Troians had in Carthage made no
         stay.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Professor Zielinski’s next argument is singularly
unconvincing. He says: “The situation (<i>i.e.</i> in the Epistle
and in the Play) is parallel even in details, as everyone will tell
himself: moreover the poet himself confesses it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dido and her Æneas shall want troops</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the haunt be ours.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> xiv. 51.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">But in the first place this has reference not to
the separation but to the reunion: and in the second place, of the
reunion there is no word in the Epistle. I cannot therefore see how
Shakespeare’s lines can be taken as a confession of indebtedness to
Ovid. But these analogies, real or imaginary, lead up to Professor
Zielinski’s main point. He quotes as what he calls the “Motiv des
Kindes” and considers the distinctive feature of Ovid’s treatment,
Dido’s reproach:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Forsitan et gravidam Didon, scelerate, relinquas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Parsque tui lateat corpore clausa meo.&emsp;(line 131.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">He admits that it is not easy to find this “Motiv”
in the play, but argues that Shakespeare was always very reticent in
such regards. Then he proceeds: “Hier nun war Kleopatra tatsächlich
schwanger, als Antonius sie verliess: Plutarch setzt es c. 36 voraus,
und Shakespeare wird es gewusst haben, da er Act III. die Kinder
erwähnt. Sollte er in der grossen Abschieds-scene das dankbare Motiv
haben entgehen lassen? Sehn wir zu. Kleopatra spielt die nervöse, ihr
ist bald gut, bald schlecht: ‘schnür mich auf ... nein, lass es sein.’
Ihre ungerechten Vorwürfe bringen den Antonius endlich auf; er will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</span>
gehn. Sie hält ihn zurück: <i>courteous lord, one word</i>. Wir
erwarten eine wichtige Erklärung; was wird das ‘eine Wort’ sein?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir, you and I must part—but that’s not it:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir, you and I have loved—but there’s not it;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you know well: something it is I would—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O, <i>my oblivion is a very Antony</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I am all forgotten.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Es ist für den klassischen Philologen erheiternd
und tröstlich, die Commentare zum hervorgehoben verse zu lesen:
dieselben Torheiten, wie bei uns, wenn einer das erklären muss,
was er selber nicht versteht. Man wollte sogar <i>oblivion</i>
hinausconjiciren: andere befehlen es = <i>memory</i> zu nehmen. Was
wird dadurch gewonnen? Ich verlange das versprochene ‘eine wort.’—‘Ja,
das hat sie eben vergessen’—Ich danke. Nein, sie hat es ausgesprochen:
ihr ‘Vergessen’ war in der Tat ‘ein echter Antonius,’ wenn auch ein
ganz kleiner. Und als der Freund die Anspielung nicht versteht—<i>I
should take you for idleness itself</i>—fährt sie bitter fort:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent21">’Tis sweating labour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>To bear such idleness so near the heart</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As Cleopatra <i>this</i>.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">(das <i>this</i> mit discret hinweisender
Geberde).... Es wäre Mangel an Zartgefühl, mehr zu verlangen.—Und
wirklich, besser als die Erklärer hat ein Dichter den Dichter
verstanden; ich meine Puschkin, der in einer Stelle seiner lieblichen
‘Nixe’ (Rusalka) die oben ausgeschriebenen Worte der Kleopatra offenbar
nachahmen wollte:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Fürst.</i> Leb’ wohl.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Mädchen.</i> Nein, wart ... ich muss dir etwas sagen ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Weiss nimmer was.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Fürst.</i><span class="ws3">So denke nach!</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent2"><i>Mädchen.</i><span class="ws8">Für dich</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wär ich bereit.... Nein das ist’s nicht.... So wart doch.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ich kann’s nicht glauben, dass du mich auf ewig</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Verlassen willst.... Nein, das ist’s immer nicht....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jetzt hab’ ich’s: heut war’s, dass zum ersten Mal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dein kind sich unter’m Herzen mir bewegte.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">This is very ingenious, and the parallel from
Puschkin is very interesting. What makes one doubtful is that from
first to last Shakespeare slurs over the motherhood of Cleopatra, to
which the other tragedians of the time give great prominence. On the
whole he obliterates even those references that Plutarch makes to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</span>
aspect of his heroine, and it would therefore be odd if he went out
of his way to invent an allusion which does not fit in with the rest
of the picture, and which is without consequence and very obscure. If
one were forced to conjecture the “missing word,” it would be more
plausible to suppose that she both wishes and hesitates to suggest
marriage with Antony. At the close, her exclamation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent23">Husband, I come:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now to that name my courage prove my title!</div>
    <div class="verse indent28">(<span class="allsmcap">V.</span> ii. 290.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">shows that she recognises the dignity of the
sanction. At the outset, she feels the falsity of her position, as
we see from her reference to “the married woman”; and in Plutarch
Shakespeare had read the complaint of her partisans, that “Cleopatra,
being borne a Queene of so many thousands of men, is onely named
Antonius Leman.” In Rome the marriage is assumed to be quite probable;
and in this very scene Antony, after announcing the removal of the
grand impediment by Fulvia’s death, has just professed his unalterable
devotion to his Queen. Why should there not be a marriage, unless he
regards her merely as a mistress; and why should she not propose it,
except that she fears to meet with this rebuff? The “sweating labour”
she bears would thus be her unsanctioned love and its disgrace.</p>

<p>This, however, is not put forward as a serious interpretation, but
only as a theory quite as possible as Professor Zielinski’s. The most
obvious and the most satisfactory way is to suppose, as probably almost
every reader does and has done, that she is merely making pretexts
to postpone the separation. And there is surely no great difficulty
about the phrase: “My oblivion is a very Antony.” Here too the obvious
explanation is the most convincing: “My forgetfulness is as great as
Antony’s own.”</p>

<p class="f120 space-below2">THE “INEXPLICABLE” PASSAGE<br />
IN <i>CORIOLANUS</i></p>

<p>Coleridge, in his <i>Notes on Shakespeare</i> (1818, Section IV.),
calls attention to the difficulty of Aufidius’ speech to his lieutenant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All places yield to him ere he sits down;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the nobility of Rome are his:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The senators and patricians love him too:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To expel him thence.&emsp;I think he’ll be to Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By sovereignty of nature.&emsp;First he was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A noble servant to them; but he could not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Carry his honours even: whether ’twas pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which out of daily fortune ever taints</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The happy man; whether defect of judgement,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To fail in the disposing of those chances</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which he was lord of; or whether nature,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not to be other than one thing, not moving</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even with the same austerity and garb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he controll’d the war; but one of these—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he hath spices of them all, not all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For I dare so far free him—made him fear’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So hated, and so banish’d, but he has a merit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To choke it in the utterance.&emsp;So our virtues</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lie in the interpretation of the time;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And power, unto itself most commendable,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To extol what it hath done.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come, let’s away.&emsp;When, Caius, Rome is thine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou art poor’st of all: then shortly art thou mine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent30">(<span class="allsmcap">IV.</span> vii. 28.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Here there are puzzling expressions in detail, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</span>
they have on the whole been satisfactorily explained, and it is not to
them that Coleridge refers.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
He says: “I have always thought this in itself so beautiful speech the
least explicable from the mood and full intention of the speaker of any
in the whole works of Shakespeare.” It strikes one indeed as a series
of disconnected jottings that have as little to do with each other as
with the situation and attitude of Aufidius. First he gives reason for
expecting the capture of Rome; then he enumerates defects in Coriolanus
that have led to his banishment with a supplementary acknowledgment
of his merits; next he makes general reflections on the relation of
virtue to the construction put upon it, and on the danger that lies in
conspicuous power: thereafter he points out that things are brought to
nought by themselves or their likes; and finally he predicts that when
Rome is taken, he will get the better of his rival.</p>

<p>Is there here a mere congeries of thoughts as one chance suggestion
leads to another with which it happens to be casually associated; or
does one thread of continuous meaning run through the whole? I would
venture to maintain the latter opinion with more confidence than I do,
if Coleridge had not been so emphatic.</p>

<p>In the first place we have to remember what goes before. The report
of the Lieutenant confirms the jealousy of Aufidius, who is further
embittered by the hint that he is losing credit, but reflects that he
can bring weighty charges against Coriolanus, and concludes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent23">He hath left undone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whene’er we come to our account.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="no-indent">Thereupon the Lieutenant meaningly rejoins:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sir, I beseech you, think you he’ll carry Rome?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is a contingency to be reckoned with, for clearly if Rome falls, any
previous mistakes or complaisances alleged against the conqueror will
find ready pardon. So Aufidius discusses the matter in the light of
these two main considerations: (1) that he must get rid of his rival,
and (2) that his rival may do the state a crowning service. He admits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</span>
that Coriolanus, what with his own efficiency, what with the
friendliness of one class in Rome and the helplessness of the
remainder, is likely to achieve the grand exploit. How then will
Aufidius’ chances stand? Formerly Marcius deserved as well of his own
country when he had overthrown Corioli, yet that did not secure him.
What qualities in himself discounted his services to Rome and may
again discount his services to Antium? Pride of prosperity, disregard
of his opportunities, his unaccommodating peremptory behaviour—all
of these faults which in point of fact afterwards contributed to his
death—brought about his banishment, though truly he had merit enough
to make men overlook such trifles. This shows how worth depends on the
way it is taken, and how ability, even when of the sterling kind that
wins its own approval, may find the throne of its public recognition
to be, more properly, its certain grave. Thus likes counteract likes;
the greater the popularity, the greater the reaction; the greater the
superiority, the more certainly it will balk itself. So, and this is
the conclusion of the whole matter, even when Marcius has won Rome by a
greater conquest than when he won Corioli, the result will be the same.
His proud, imprudent and overbearing conduct will obscure his high
deserts. These will be construed only by public opinion, and the very
prowess in which he delights will rouse an adulation, which, when he is
no longer required, will swing round to its opposite. So his success
will correct itself. His very triumph over Rome will be guarantee for
Aufidius’ triumph over him.</p>

<p>If this amplified paraphrase give the meaning, that meaning is coherent
enough and is quite suitable to the mood and attitude of the speaker.</p>

‘real live book,’ and ought to find a place side by side with the
volumes of Coleridge, Lamb, Hazlitt, and Swinburne, among the best and
most illuminative specimens of English dramatic criticism.”—Mr.
<span class="smcap">W. L. Courtney</span> in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p>“An admirable piece of work. To call it the most luminous piece of
Shakespearean criticism that has ever been written would be to pretend
to an impossible familiarity with the whole gigantic literature of
the subject. Let me only say, then, that no such minutely searching
and patiently convincing studies of Shakespeare are known to me.”—Mr.
<span class="smcap">William Archer</span> in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>“Professor Bradley realises to the full the depth and the delicacy
and the darkness of his subject; and realising this, he contrives to
say some very admirable things about it.”—Mr. <span class="smcap">G. K.
Chesterton</span> in the <i>Daily News</i>.</p>

<p>“A remarkable achievement.... It is probable that
this volume will attain a permanence for which
critical literature generally cannot hope. Very
many of the things that are said here are finally
said; they exhaust their subject. Of one thing
we are certain—that there is no work in English
devoted to the interpretation of poetic experience
which can claim the delicacy and sureness of Mr.
Bradley’s.”—<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>“This is not a book to be written about in a hasty
review of a thousand words. It is one to be perused
and appreciated at leisure—to be returned to again
and again, partly because of its supreme interest,
partly because it provokes, as all good books should
do, a certain antagonism, partly because it is itself
the product of a careful, scholarly mind, basing
conclusions on a scrupulous perusal of documents and
authorities.... The whole book is so full of good
things that it is impossible to make any adequate
selection. In an age which is not supposed to be
very much interested in literary criticism, a book
like Mr. Bradley’s is of no little significance and
importance.”—<i>Daily Telegraph.</i></p>

I am quite unable to agree with Herr Collischonn’s view that Muret’s
play is more republican in sentiment than that of Grévin. In both
there is some discrepancy and contradiction, but with Muret, Caesar is
a more prominent figure than Brutus, taking part in three scenes, if
we include his intervention after death, while Brutus appears only in
two, and to my mind Caesar makes fully as sympathetic an impression.
On the other hand, the alleged monarchic bias of Grévin’s work cannot
be considered very pronounced, when, as M. Faguet mentions in his
<i>Tragédie française au XVIͤ Siècle</i>, “it was reprinted in the
time of Ravaillac with a preface violently hostile to the principle
of monarchy.” But see Herr Collischonn’s excellent introduction to
his <i>Grevin’s Tragödie “Caesar,” Ausgaben und Abhandlungen, etc.,

There is an edition of this by Miss Alice Luce, <i>Literarhistorische
Forschungen</i>, 1897, but I am told it is out of print, and at
any rate I have been unable to procure it. The extracts I give are
transcripts from the British Museum copy, which is indexed thus:
<i>Discourse of Life and Death written in French by P. Mornay. Antonius
a tragedie, written also in French by R. Garnier. Both done in English
by the Countesse of Pembroke, 1592</i>. This edition has generally been
overlooked by historians of the drama, from Professor Ward to Professor
Schelling (probably because it is associated with Mornay’s tract),
and, as a rule, the translation of Garnier is said to have been first
published in 1595. That and the subsequent editions bear a different
title from the neglected first; the <i>Tragedie of Antonie</i>, instead
of <i>Antonius</i>.</p>

That is, in the original version. Subsequently Daniel threw a later
narrative passage describing Cleopatra’s parting from Caesarion and
Rodon into scenic form, introduced it here, and followed it up with a
discussion between Caesar and his advisers. This seems to be one of
his attempts to impart more dramatic animation to his play, and it
does so. But as dramatic animation is not what we are looking for, the
improvement is doubtful.</p>

Professor Ward calls attention to the stage direction(Act <span class="smcap">iii.</span>):
“Enter Sylla in triumph in his chair triumphant
of gold, drawn by four Moors; before the chariot, his colours, his
crest, his captains, his prisoners; ... bearing crowns of gold and
manacled.” This, he points out, seems a reminiscence of the similar
situation in <i>Tamburlaine II.</i>, Act iv. sc. 3.: “Enter Tamberlaine
drawn in his chariot by the Kings of Trebizon and Soria, with bits in
their mouths, reins in his left hand, and in his right hand a whip with
which he scourgeth them.” From this Professor Ward infers that Lodge’s
play belongs approximately to the same date as Marlowe’s, possibly to
1587. It may be so, but there are some reasons for placing it later.
The mixture of rhyme and prose instead of the exclusive use of blank
verse would suggest that the influence of <i>Tamburlaine</i> was not
very immediate. It has some points of contact with the <i>Looking
Glass</i> which Lodge wrote along with Greene. It has the same didactic
bent, though the purpose is political rather than moral, for the
<i>Wounds of Civill War</i> enforces on its very title page the lesson
that Elizabethans had so much at heart, the need of harmony in the
State. Like the <i>Looking Glass</i> it deals rather with an historic
transaction than with individual adventures, for it summarises the
whole disastrous period of the conflict between Marius and Sulla. And
like the <i>Looking Glass</i> it visualises this by scenes taken alike
from dignified and low life, the latter even more out of place than
the episodes of the Nineveh citizens and peasants in the joint work.
In so far one is tempted to put the two together about 1591. And there
is one detail that perhaps favours this view—the introduction of
the Gaul with his bad English and worse French. In Greene’s <i>James
IV.</i> (c. 1590) the assassin hired to murder Queen Dorothea is also a
Frenchman who speaks broken English, and in that play such a personage
is quite in keeping, violating the probabilities neither of time nor of
place. It is, therefore, much more probable that, if he proved popular,
Lodge would reproduce the same character inappropriately to catch the
applause of the groundlings, than that Lodge should light on the first
invention when that invention was quite unsuitable, and that Greene
should afterwards borrow it and give it a fit setting. In the latter
case we can only account for the absurdity by supposing that Lodge
carried much further the anachronism in <i>Cornelia</i> of “the fierce
and fiery-humour’d French.”</p>

<i>I.e.</i> more tragic in the technical sense. Of course Mr. Bradley
is quite aware that as it stands <i>Coriolanus</i> is “a much nobler
play.” It is right to add that he expresses no opinion whether the
actual close of Shakespeare’s play “was due simply to his unwillingness
to contradict his historical authority on a point of such magnitude.”
At any rate, I am convinced that in his eyes that was a sufficient ground.</p>

Even in the narrative passages one is conscious that the
descriptions have been worked up. Take, <i>e.g.</i> the following
passage from the <i>Life of Marius</i>:—</p>

<p>Ἐπεὶ δὲ πολλοὺς τῶν Ἀμβρώνων οἰ Ῥωμαῖοι διαφθείραντες ἀνεχώρησαν ὀπίσω
καὶ σκότος ἐπέσχεν, οὐχ ὥσπερ εὐτυχήματι τοσούτῳ τὸν στρατὸν ἐδέξαντο
παιᾶνες ἐπινίκιοι καὶ πότοι κατὰ σκηνὰς καὶ φιλοφροσύναι περὶ δεῖπνα,
καὶ, τὸ πάντων ἥδιστον ἀνδράσιν εὐτυχῶς μεμαχημένοις, ὕπνος ἤπιος,
ἀλλ’ ἐκείνην μάλιστα τὴν νύκτα φοβερὰν καὶ ταραχώδη διήγαγον. Ἦν μὲν
γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἀχαράκωτον τὸ στρατόπεδον καὶ ἀτείχιστον, ἀπελείποντο δὲ
τῶν βαρβάρων ἔτι πολλαὶ μυριάδες ἀήττητοι καὶ σνμμεμιγμένων τούτοις,
ὅσοι διαπεφεύγεσαν, τῶν Ἀμβρώνων ὀδυρμὸς ἦν διὰ νυκτὸς, οὐ κλαυθμοῖς
ούδὲ στεναγμοῖς ἀνθρώπων ἐοικῶς, ἀλλὰ θηρομιγής τις ὠρυγὴ καὶ βρύχημα
μεμιγμένον ἀπειλαῖς καὶ θρήνοις ἀναπεμπόμενον ἐκ πλήθους τοσούτου τά
τε πέριξ ὄρη καὶ τὰ κοῖλα τοῦ ποταμοῦ περιεφώνει. Καὶ κατεῖχε φρικώδης
ἦχος τὸ πεδίον.</p>

<p class="author">(XX. Döhner’s Edition.)</p>

<p class="space-above2">Or take this from the <i>Life of Sulla</i>:—</p>

<p>Τὴν δὲ κραυγὴν καὶ ἀλαλαγμὸν οὐκ ἔστεγεν ὁ ἀὴρ ἐθνῶν τοσούτων ἅμα
καθισταμένων εἰς τάξιν. Ἤν δὲ ἅμα καὶ τὸ κομπῶδες καὶ σοβαρὸν αὐτῶν

<p>This is very different from the unstudied charm of Herodotus. Even in
North’s translation, though something of the cunning has been lost in
the selection and manipulation of the words, it is easy to see that the
pictures are elaborate both in their general effect and their details.</p>

<p>Now the Romaines, after they had overcome the most parte of the
Ambrons, retyring backe by reason the night had overtaken them, did
not (as they were wont after they had geven such an overthrow) sing
songes of victory and triumphe, nor make good chere in their tentes
one with an other, and least of all sleepe: (which is the best and
sweetest refreshing for men that have fought happely), but contrarily
they watched all that night with great feare and trouble, bicause their
campe was not trenched and fortified, and bicause they knewe also that
there remained almost innumerable thowsandes of barbarous people, that
had not yet fought: besides also that the Ambrons that had fled and
scaped from the overthrow, did howle out all night with lowd cries,
which were nothing like men’s lamentacions and sighes, but rather like
wild beastes bellowing and roaringe. So that the bellowinge of such a
great multitude of beastly people, mingled together with threates and
waylinges, made the mountains thereabouts and the running river to
rebounde againe of the sounde and ecco of their cries marvellously:
by reason whereof, all the valley that lay between both, thundered to
heare the horrible and fearfull trembling.</p>

<p>The ayer was even cut a sunder as it were with the violence of the
noyse and cries of so many sundry nations, which altogether did put
them selves in battell ray. The sumptuousness of their furniture
moreover, was not altogether superfluous and unprofitable, but served
greatly to feare the beholders. For the glistering of their harnesse,
so richly trimmed and set forth with gold and silver, the cullers of
their arming coates upon their curaces, after the facion of the Medes
and Scythians, mingled with the bright glistering steele and shining
copper, gave such a showe as they went and removed to and fro, that
made a light as clere as if all had bene on a very fire, a fearfull
thing to looke upon. In so much as the Romaines durst not so much as
once goe out of the trenches of their campe, nor Sylla with all his
perswasion coulde take away this great conceived feare from them:
wherefore, (and bicause also he would not compell them to goe forth in
this feare) he was driven not to stirre, but close to abide, (though
it grieved him greatly) to see the barbarous people so proudly and
villanously laugh him and his men to scorne.</p>

There are so many good things, despite all the inevitable mistakes, in
Dryden’s <i>Life of Plutarch</i>, that one half regrets that Professor
Ker’s plan did not allow him to include at least part of it in his
admirable selection. Thus, in excuse for omitting the catalogue of
Plutarch’s lost works, which had been given in full in the Paris
edition: “But it is a small comfort to the merchant to pursue his bill
of freight when he is certain his ship is cast away; moved by the like
reason, I have omitted that ungrateful task.”</p>

De Quincey says: “Nor do I believe Wordsworth would much have lamented
on his own account if all books had perished, except the entire body
of English poetry and Plutarch’s Lives.... I do not mean to insinuate
that Wordsworth was at all in the dark about the inaccuracy or want of
authentic weight attaching to Plutarch as historian, but his business
with Plutarch was not for <i>purposes of research</i>; he was satisfied
with his <i>fine moral effects</i>.” So too one of Plutarch’s latest
editors, Mr. Holden, says in a similar sense: “Plutarch has no idea of
historic criticism.... He thought far less of finding out and relating
what actually occurred than of edifying his readers and promoting virtue.”</p>

Les livres qui m’y servent, c’est Plutarque depuis qu’il est françois,
et Seneque (ii. iv.). Of course Montaigne knew some Greek and read it
more or less. He has even his own opinion about Plutarch’s style
(<a href="#Page_104">see page 104</a>), and M. Faguet conjectures:
“It is quite conceivable that Montaigne compared the translation with
the text, and that it is a piece of mere affectation when he says he
knows nothing of the Greek.” But doubtless he read the French much more
habitually and easily.</p>

There were also translations in Italian, Spanish, and German; but
none of them had anything like the literary importance of Amyot’s,
and they were made from the Latin, not from the Greek. Of Hieronymus
Boner, for instance, who published his <i>Plutarch, Von dem Leben der
allerdurchlauchtigsten Griechen und Romern</i> (1st edition, Augsburg,
1534), it is misleading to say that he “anticipated” Amyot. Merzdorf
writes of Boner’s versions of Greek authors generally (<i>Allgemeine
Deutsche Biographie</i>) that he “turned them into German not from the
original Greek but from Latin translations. Moreover, one must not
expect from him any exact rendering, but rather a kind of paraphrase
which he accommodates to the circumstances of the time.”</p>

Espineux et ferré (ii. iv.). Perhaps <i>ferré</i> should be rendered
<i>difficult</i> rather than <i>crabbed</i>. But even <i>thorny and
difficult</i> are hardly words that one would apply to Plutarch.
Montaigne’s meaning may perhaps be illustrated by the criticism of
Paley: “Plutarch’s Greek is not like Lucian’s, fluent and easy, nor
even clear.” He uses many words not in the ordinary Greek vocabulary;
and he too often constructs long sentences, the thread of which
separately as well as the connection cannot be traced without close
attention. Hence he is unattractive as a writer.</p>

The whole question about the editions which Shakespeare read is a
complicated one. Two things are pretty certain: (1) He must have used
the first edition for <i>Midsummer-Night’s Dream</i>, which was in
all likelihood composed before 1595, when the second appeared. (2) He
must have used the first or second for <i>Julius Caesar</i>, which was
composed before 1603, when the third appeared. It is more difficult
to speak positively in regard to <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> and
<i>Coriolanus</i>. It has been argued that the former cannot have been
derived from the first two editions, because in them Menas’ remark to
Sextus Pompeius runs:</p>

<p class="blockquot">“Shall I cut the gables of the ankers, and make
thee Lord not only of Sicile and Sardinia, but of the whole Empire of
Rome besides?”</p>

<p>In the third edition this is altered to <i>cables</i>, and this is the
form that occurs in Shakespeare:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent22">“Let me cut the cable;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All there is thine.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent18">(<i>A. and C.</i> <span class="allsmcap">II.</span> vii. 77.)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But this change is a very slight one that Shakespeare might easily
make for himself on the same motives that induced the editor of
the <i>Lives</i> to make it. And though attempts have been made to
prove that the fourth edition was used for <i>Coriolanus</i>, there
are great difficulties in accepting so late a date for that play,
and one phrase rather points to one of the first two editions (see
Introduction to <i>Coriolanus</i>). If this is really so, it affects
the case of <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> too, for it would be odd to
find Shakespeare using the first or second edition for the latter play,
and the third for the earlier one. Still, such things do occur, and I
think there is a tendency in those who discuss this point to confine
Shakespeare over rigidly to one edition. In the twentieth century it
is possible to find men reading or re-reading a book in the first copy
that comes to hand without first looking up the date on the title page.
Was this practice unknown in Shakespeare’s day?</p>

Calpùrnia speaks of the appearance of comets at the death of princes,
but merely in a general way, not as a presage then to be observed: and
there is no mention in the play of disasters in the sun or eclipses of
the moon. Near the end of the <i>Life of Caesar</i>, Plutarch records
the first two portents, and his language suggests the idea of a solar,
which, for variety’s sake, might easily be changed to a lunar eclipse.
“The great comet which seven nightes together was seene very bright
after Caesar’s death, the eight night after was never seene more. Also
the <i>brightnes of the sunne was darkened</i>, the which all that
yeare through was very pale, and shined not out, whereby it gave but

Possibly he may have found a suggestion for this in Plutarch’s

On this passage Coleridge has the note: “This seemingly
strange assertion of Brutus is unhappily verified in the present day.
What is an immense army, in which the lust of plunder has quenched
all the duties of the citizen, other than a horde of robbers, or
differenced only as fiends from ordinarily reprobate men? Caesar
supported, and was supported by, such as these;—and even so Buonaparte
in our days.” On this interpretation Brutus’ charge would come to
nothing more than this, that Caesar had employed large armies. I
believe there is a more definite reference to one passage or possibly
two in the <i>Marcus Antonius</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“(<i>a</i>) Caesar’s friends that governed under him, were cause why
they hated Caesar’s government ... by reason of the great insolencies
and outragious parts that were committed: amongst whom Antonius, that
was of greatest power, and that also committed greatest faultes,
deserved most blame. But Caesar, notwithstanding, when he returned from
the warres of Spayne, made no reckoning of the complaints that were put
up against him: but contrarily, bicause he found him a hardy man, and a
valliant Captaine, he employed him in his chiefest affayres.</p>

<p>“(<i>b</i>) Now it greved men much, to see that Caesar should be out
of Italy following of his enemies, to end this great warre, with such
great perill and daunger: and that others in the meane time abusing
his name and authoritie, should commit such insolent and outragious
parts unto their citizens. This me thinkes was the cause that made the
conspiracie against Caesar increase more and more, and layed the reynes
of the brydle uppon the souldiers neckes, whereby they durst boldlier
commit many extorsions, cruelties, and robberies.”</p>

<p>Plutarch is speaking of Antony in particular, but surely this is the
sort of thing that was in Shakespeare’s mind.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="label">[161]</a>
Coleridge’s exact words, in continuation of the passage already
discussed may be quoted. “How too could Brutus say that he found no
personal cause, none in Caesar’s past conduct as a man? Had he not
passed the Rubicon? Had he not entered Rome as a conqueror? Had he not
placed his Gauls in the Senate?—Shakespeare, it may be said, has not
brought these things forward.—True;—and this is just the cause of my
perplexity. What character did Shakespeare mean his Brutus to be?”</p>

<p>The verbal answer to this is of course that <i>personal cause</i>
refers not to Caesar but to Brutus, and means that Brutus has no
private grievance; but the substance of Coleridge’s objection remains
unaffected, for Brutus proceeds to take Caesar’s character up to the
present time under his protection.</p>

<p>It may be noted, however, that Plutarch says nothing about the Gauls.
If Shakespeare had known of it, it would probably have seemed to him
no worse than the presence of the Bretons, “those overweening rags of

All this is so obvious that it can hardly be overlooked, yet overlooked
it has been, though it has frequently been pointed out. In his not
very sympathetic discussion of this play, Dr. Brandes makes the truly
astounding statement: “As Shakespeare conceives the situation, the
Republic which Caesar overthrew, might have continued to exist but for
him, and it was a criminal act on his part to destroy it.... ‘If we try
to conceive to ourselves’ wrote Mommsen in 1857, ’a London with the
slave population of New Orleans, with the police of Constantinople,
with the non-industrial character of modern Rome, and agitated by
politics after the fashion of the Paris of 1848, we shall acquire an
approximate idea of the republican glory, the departure of which Cicero
and his associates in their sulky letters deplore.’ Compare with this
picture Shakespeare’s conception of an ambitious Caesar striving to
introduce monarchy into a well-ordered republican state” (Brandes,
<i>William Shakespeare</i>). Of course Shakespeare had not read Mommsen
or any of Mommsen’s documents, save Plutarch; and if he had, neither
he nor any one else of his age, was capable of Mommsen’s critical and
constructive research. But considering the <i>data</i> that Plutarch
delivered him he shows marvellous power in getting to the gist of the
matter. I think we rise with a clearer idea, after reading him than
after reading Plutarch, of the hopelessness and vanity of opposing the
changes that Caesar represented, of the effeteness of the republican
system (“Let him be Caesar!” cries the citizen in his strange
recognition of Brutus’ achievement), of the chaos that imperialism
alone could reduce to rule. If Shakespeare’s picture of Rome is that
of “a well-ordered republican state,” one wonders what the picture of
a republic in decay would be. And where does Dr. Brandes find that
Shakespeare viewed Caesar’s enterprise as a criminal act?</p>

Of course the substitution of the third for the second or first person
is very noticeable all through this play, and may have been due to an
idea on Shakespeare’s part that such a mode of utterance suited the
classical and Roman majesty of the theme. But this rather confirms
than refutes the argument of the text, for the usage is exceptionally
conspicuous in regard to Caesar, in whom the majesty of Rome is summed up.</p>

It will be noticed that in this episode Shakespeare has altered
Plutarch’s narrative in two respects. In the first place Cassius did
give money to the amount of “the thirde part of his totall summe.”
This is not very important, as in the play he disclaims having ever
refused it. But in the second place Brutus was neither so scrupulous
nor so unsuccessful in raising supplies, but had used them in a
quite practical way, that Captain Mahan would thoroughly approve, in
developing his sea power: “all that he could rappe and rend ... he had
bestowed it in making so great a number of shippes that by meanes of
them they should keepe all the sea at their commaundement.”</p>

Two objections have been made to this scene, or, rather to the whole
act. The first, in Mr. Bradley’s words that it has a “tendency to
drag” (<i>Shakespearian Tragedy</i>), is put more uncompromisingly
by Mr. Baker (<i>Development of Shakespeare as a Dramatist</i>);
“[Shakespeare] produced in <i>Julius Caesar</i> a fourth act probably
not entirely successful even in his own day”; and afterwards he
refers to it as “ineffective to-day.” In view of Digges’ testimony,
it is difficult to see how Mr. Baker can say that it was not entirely
successful in Shakespeare’s day. As to the impression it makes now, one
must largely depend on one’s own feeling and experience. Certainly I
myself have never been conscious that it dragged or was ineffective,
nor have I noted that it failed to stir the audience. I have never been
present at a first-rate performance, but I have seen it creditably
presented in Germany, England and Australia; and on every occasion it
seemed to me that the quarrel scene was the most popularly successful
in the play. This statement is, I believe, strictly accurate, for
having Digges’ lines in my mind I was on the watch to see whether
the taste of the Elizabethan coincided with the taste of a later generation.</p>

<p>The second criticism is that in the economy of the piece it leads to
nothing, “unless,” as Mr. Bradley says, “we may hold that but for the
quarrel and reconciliation, Cassius would not have allowed Brutus
to overcome his objection to the fatal policy of offering battle at
Philippi.” This is quite true, though the proviso is a most important
one. But it does very manifestly connect with what has gone before,
and gives the essence and net result of the story. We could sooner
dispense with the Fifth Act than the Fourth, for the Fifth may with
less injustice be described as an appendix than the Fourth as an
episode. Not only is it less unique in kind, but for the most part it
works out issues that can easily be foreseen and that to some extent
are clearly indicated here. Of course this is not to say that it could
be rejected without mutilating the play, for it works them out far
more impressively than we could do in our own imaginations, even with
Plutarch to help us.</p>

This explanation is offered with great diffidence, but it is the only
one I can suggest for what is perhaps the most perplexing passage in
the play, not even excepting the soliloquy of Brutus.</p>

What a strange effect these words are apt to produce on auditor and
reader! “How true!” we say, “The prophecy is fulfilled. This is
happening now.” And then the reflection comes that just because that
is the case there is no prophecy and no truth in the scene; the whole
is being enacted, in sport. We experience a kind of vertigo, in which
we cannot distinguish the real and the illusory and yet are conscious
of both in their highest potence. And this is a characteristic of
all poetry, though it is not always brought so clearly before the
mind. In Shakespeare something of the kind is frequent: compare the
reference to the “squeaking Cleopatra” in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>,
which is almost exactly parallel; compare too his favourite device
of the play within the play, when we see the actors of a few minutes
ago, sitting like ourselves as auditors; and thus, on the one hand
their own performance seems comparatively real, but on the other
there is the constant reminder that we are in their position, and the
whole is merely spectacular. Dr. Brandes has some excellent remarks
in this connection on Tieck’s Dramas in his <i>Romantic School in
Germany</i>.</p></div>

Plutarch’s account of Caesar’s personal prowess in the battle with
the Nervii, and of the honours decreed him by the Senate, shows why
Shakespeare chose this exploit for special mention: “Had not Caesar
selfe taken his shield on his arme, and flying in amongest the
barbarous people, made a lane through them that fought before him; and
the tenth legion also seeing him in daunger, ronne unto him from the
toppe of the hill, where they stoode in battell,<b>{note}</b> and broken the
ranckes of their enemies; there had not a Romane escaped a live that
day. But taking example of Caesar’s valliantnes, they fought desperatly
beyond their power, and yet could not make the Nervians flie, but they
fought it out to the death, till they were all in manner slaine in
the field.... The Senate understanding it at Rome, ordained that they
shoulde doe sacrifice unto the goddes, and keepe feasts and solemne
processions fifteene dayes together without intermission, having
never made the like ordinaunce at Rome, for any victorie that ever
was obteined. Bicause they saw the daunger had bene marvelous great,
so many nations rising as they did in armes together against him: and
further the love of the people unto him made his victorie much more famous.”</p>

I have said nothing of other possible references and loans because they
seem to me irrelevant or doubtful. Thus Malone drew attention to the
words of Morose in Ben Jonson’s <i>Epicoene</i>: “Nay, I would sit out
a play that were nothing but fights at sea, drum, trumpet and target.”
He thought that this remark might contain ironical allusion to the
battle scenes in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, for instance the stage
direction at the head of Act <span class="smcap">iii.</span>, Scene
10: “Canidius marcheth with his land army one way over the stage: and
Taurus, the lieutenant of Caesar the other way. After their going in is
heard the noise of a sea-fight.” But even were this more certain than
it is, it would only prove that <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> had made
so much impression as to give points to the satirist some time after
its performance: it would not help us to the date. For <i>Epicoene</i>
belongs to 1610, and no one would place <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> so late.</p>

Besides the plays discussed in the Introduction as having a possible
place in the lineage of Shakespeare’s, others were produced on the
Continent, which in that respect are quite negligible but which
serve to prove the widespread interest in the subject. Thus in 1560
Hans Sachs in Germany composed, in seven acts, one of his homespun,
well-meant dramas that were intended to edify spectator or reader.
Thus in 1583 Cinthio in Italy treated the same theme, and it has
been conjectured, by Klein, that his <i>Cleopatra</i> was known to
Shakespeare. Certainly Shakespeare makes use of Cinthio’s novels, but
the particulars signalised by Klein, that are common to the English
and to the Italian tragedy, which latter I have not been able to
procure, are, to use Klein’s own term, merely “external,” and are
to be explained, in so far as they are valid at all, which Moeller
(<i>Kleopatra in der Tragödien-Literatur</i>) disputes, by reference to
Plutarch. An additional one which Moeller suggests without attaching
much weight to it, is even less plausible than he supposes. He points
out that Octavius’ emissary, who in Plutarch is called Thyrsus, in
Cinthio becomes Tireo, as in Shakespeare he similarly becomes Thyreus;
but he notes that this is also the name that Shakespeare would get from
North. As a matter of fact, however, in the 1623 folio of <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i> and in subsequent editions till the time of Theobald,
this personage, for some reason or other as yet undiscovered, is
styled Thidias; so the alleged coincidence is not so much unimportant
as fallacious. A third tragedy, Montreuil’s <i>Cléopatre</i>, which
like Cinthio’s is inaccessible to me, was published in France in 1595;
but to judge from Moeller’s analysis and the list of <i>dramatis
personae</i>, it has no contact with Shakespeare’s.</p>

It is rather strange that Shakespeare, whose “accessories” are
usually relevant, should choose such a subject for the decoration
of Imogen’s room. Mr. Bradley, in a note to his essay on <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i> says: “Of the ‘good’ heroines, Imogen is the one
who has most of [Cleopatra’s] spirit of fire and air.” This is one
of the things one sees to be true as soon as one reads it: can it be
that their creator has brought them into association through some feeling,
conscious or unconscious, of their kinship in this important respect?</p>

<p>I regret that Mr. Bradley’s admirable study, which appeared when I
was travelling in the Far East, escaped my notice till a few days ago,
when it was too late to use it for my discussion.</p>

Of course the division into scenes is not indicated in the Folio, but
a new “place” is obviously required for this conversation. Of course,
too, change of scene did not mean so much on the Elizabethan as on the
modern stage, but it must always have counted for something. Every
allowance made, the above criticism seems to me valid.</p>

The irony of the proposal, which Plutarch indicates but does not
stress, is entirely lost in Shakespeare. We have already been told
that Hipparchus “was the first of all his (<i>i.e.</i> Antony’s)
infranchised bondmen that revolted from him and yelded unto Caesar”; so
Caesar is invited to retaliate on one of his own adherents.</p>

It is interesting to note that it had already caught the fancy of
Jodelle, though being more faithful to the text in enumerating only the
kings who were actually present and taking no liberties with the names

This may be said even if we accept Professor Ferrero’s arguments that
Antony’s infatuation for Cleopatra was invented or exaggerated by
opponents, and that their relation was to a great extent invented or
prescribed by their ambitions. Antony would still be the profligate man
of genius, captivated by Asiatic ideals and careless of the interests
of Rome. His policy at the close would still, by Professor Ferrero’s
own admission, be traceable to the ascendancy which Cleopatra had
established over him. And the picture of contemporary conditions would
still retain a large measure of truth.</p>

If the ideas were in Shakespeare’s mind that Professor Zielinski of St.
Petersburg attributes to him (<i>Marginalien Philologus</i>, 1905),
the gracelessness of Charmian passes all bounds. “(Die) muntre Zofe
wünscht sich vom Wahrsager allerhand schöne Sachen: ’lass mich an einem
Nachmittag drei Könige heiraten, und sie alle als Wittwe überleben;
lass mich mit fünfzig Jahren ein Kind haben, dem Herodes von Judaea
huldigen soll: lass mich Octavius Caesar heiraten, etc.’ Das ‘Püppchen’
dachte sich Shakespeare jünger als ihre Herrin: fünfzig würde sie
also—um Christi Geburt. Ist es nun klar, was das für ein Kind ist,
dem Herodes von Judaea huldigen soll.’ Ἐπὰν εὕρητε, ἀπαγγείλατέ μοι,
ὅπως κᾀγὼ ἐλθῶν προσκυνήσω αὐτῷ, sagt er selber, Matth. ii. 18. Und
wem sagt er es? Den Heiligen drei Königen. Sollten es nicht dieselben
sein, die auch in Charmian’s Wunschzettel stehen? Der Einfall ist einer
Mysterie würdig: Gattin der heiligen drei Könige, Mutter Gottes, und
römische Kaiserin dazu.” Worthy of a mystery, perhaps! but more worthy
of a scurrilous lampoon. It might perhaps be pointed out, that, if
fifty years old at the beginning of the Christian era, Charmian could
only be ten at the opening of the play: but this is a small point, and
I think it very likely that Shakespeare intended to rouse some such
associations in the mind of the reader as Professor Zielinski suggests.
Mr. Furness is rather scandalised at the “frivolous irreverence,” but
it fits the part, and where is the harm? One remembers Byron’s defence
of the audacities in <i>Cain</i> and objection to making “Lucifer talk
like the Bishop of London, <i>which would not be in the character of
the former</i>.”</p>

I take this much discussed passage to refer to the friction that
inevitably arises in such a gathering. The guests are of such

the result is that he befuddles himself.</p>

The love she inspires and feels is of the kind described by La
Rochefoucauld: “L’amour, aussi bien que le feu, ne peut subsister, sans
un mouvement continuel; et il cesse de vivre dès qu’il cesse d’espérer
ou de craindre.” He has another passage that suggests an explanation
of the secret of Cleopatra’s permanent attraction for the volatile
Antony: “La constance en amour est une inconstance perpétuelle, qui
fait que notre coeur s’attache successivement à toutes les qualités
de la personne que nous aimons, donnant tantôt la préférence à l’une,
tantôt à l’autre; de sorte que cette constance n’est qu’une inconstance
arrêtée et renfermée dans un même sujet.” It is curious how often an
English reader of La Rochefoucauld feels impelled to illustrate the
Reflections on Love and Women by reference to Shakespeare’s Cleopatra,
but it is very natural. His friend the Duchess of Longueville and
the other great ladies of the Fronde resembled her in their charm,
their wit, their impulsiveness; and when they engaged in the game of
politics, subordinated it like her to their passions and caprices. So
his own experience would familiarise La Rochefoucauld with the type,
which he has merely generalised, and labelled as the only authentic one.</p>

To me the sense seems to be: Supposing the Antony I have depicted never
existed, still the conception is too great to be merely my own. It must
be an imagination of Nature herself, which she may be unable to embody,
but which shames our puny ideals. In other words, Antony is the “form”
or “type” which Nature aims at even if she does not attain. I see no reason
for changing the “nor” of the first line as it is in the folio to “or.”</p>

<p class="no-indent">This certainly is liker Livy than Plutarch; and
besides the chances of Shakespeare having read Livy in the original,
we have to bear in mind that in 1600 Philemon Holland published the
<i>Romane Historie written by Titus Livius of Padua</i>. His version,
as it is difficult to procure, may be quoted in full:</p>

<p class="blockquot">Whilome (quoth he) when as in mans bodie, all
the parts thereof agreed not, as now they do in one, but each member
had a several interest and meaning, yea, and a speech by it selfe;
so it befel, that all other parts besides the belly, thought much
and repined that by their carefulness, labor, and ministerie, all
was gotten, and yet all little enough to serve it: and the bellie it
selfe lying still in the mids of them, did nothing else but enjoy
the delightsome pleasures brought unto her. Wherupon they mutinied
and conspired altogether in this wise, That neither the hands should
reach and convey food to the mouth, nor the mouth receive it as it
came, ne yet the teeth grind and chew the same. In this mood and fit,
whiles they were minded to famish the poore bellie, behold the other
lims, yea and the whole bodie besides, pined, wasted, and fel into an
extreme consumption. Then was it wel seen, that even the very belly
also did no smal service, but fed the other parts, as it received food
it selfe: seeing that by working and concocting the meat throughlie,
it digesteth and distributeth by the veines into all parts, that fresh
and perfect blood whereby we live, we like, and have our full strength.
Comparing herewith, and making his application, to wit, how like this
intestine, and inward sedition of the bodie, was to the full stomacke
of the Commons, which they had taken and borne against the Senatours,
he turned quite the peoples hearts.</p>

point was rather that coercive legislation in regard to agriculture
hindered production and was oppressive to poor men. Nor am I aware that

an explanation even on trying to render his thought in terms of
contemporary arrangements in England. “Peers,” “parliament men,”
and “gentry” would not do.</p></div>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
